Likely it took a bit of time to conceptually develop the small solution but it seems that it mainly modifies one file (https://github.com/gchq/Gaffer/commit/6ba817a90fade5b5e28016db67012ef1aeff10da#diff-65aa4c459280f7e6cdc5e4fd46164ca7a179207e19e5d52940b5c4f00f6d84bf), It is a \"simple\" modification of an existing solution. It adds some more constraints and relaxes others to include these partial walks in results <br>Type A work.  <br>This issue might actually introduce TD since it mentions that it is a _\"simple quick solution\"_ and that the implementation of _\"gh-1754 is more complex and could be implemented in the future._<br>**Perfective Change**       | no |\n",

<br> <br>Type B work.<br> Commit 2611e58485dc55f4efadb1c1750842b8306becb1 removes dependencies to the Accumolo store from the Parquet store (decouples them by douplicating code as it seems), i.e., a refactoring. But it happens after introduction of the feature and it does not seem to be the reason for that implementation of the feature takes long. The refactoring itself takes time of course. The feature itself evolves over time getting more 'ripe' over many smaller commits.<br>A lot of tests are extended/newly created during the work.<br>The change is added by modifying existing classes, i.e., the trait cannot be \"cleanly\" added via a language construct/mechanism.<br>It also contains changes that seem unrelated to me (11c1a7f692a11f294e1d437582c4f6c6d754567e some text and data storage utility functions)<br>It also just moves code blocks around (f37ed30d2a682c9c248b34bb23bf2fbab43ce50d)<br>I do not think removing a dependency to Accumolo Store is a sign of TD.<br>**Perfective Change**         | no |\n",

Spark RDD (https://data-flair.training/blogs/spark-rdd-tutorial/) returning to Accumolo store.<br>First commit adds a lot of new files, which implement the functionality.<br>Is a proper Type C work instance.<br>Code duplication (`deduplicate`) introduced in second commit, which are mainly minor adjustments (renamings, formatting, generics, added tests etc.).https://github.com/gchq/Gaffer/commit/5fd84df114a75b3e58a164a20db7df972a45ecfb#diff-799047adca0e3fa5dfff41be623c9492a0ba3d85db4325734fbbe0a45d64ece3 in second commit might fix a bug, I do not consider it TD.<br>Is the fact that `deduplicate` has to be added to many operations a sign of TD? I do not think so, since it seems to always call the operation of the super type.<br>Class `GetElementsSeedTest` was renamed to `GetElementsBySeedTest`, which causes a lot of small changes to adapt to the new type.<br>Is forgetting of `abstract` keyword on an abstract class (https://github.com/gchq/Gaffer/commit/c2d33b7532f4d44f06feb0dfa325ad797ee55df0#diff-06a5fea73b9638ee17aeb550d28b61cc92ff7cce6886ceae85cf9cb4f368d237) TD? I do not think so.<br>In this issue it is just a lot of new functionality, which has to get tested, and which evolves before it is done, e.g. commit bbb9499c199882171d579024a88e00203463e0f4 which renames previously introduced classes or 109a59659969881f39a6c7b241ba4ab3c4ad24a2, which changes generics.<br>**Perfective Change**       | no |\n",

For example,  small hardcoded values are replaced by constants (01884a80e4916f8c08f5b546a95f27a8d6c2b060) and a lot of tests are modified and newly added.<br>I do not have the feeling that the contribution gets complex due to an underlying technical compromise. It is more that an API is implemented and to make a second version that looks similar but different one has to refactor and modify the code in multiple places. **Perfective Change**       | no |\n",

Together with this, some unit tests should be adapted.<br>During the erfactoring code is also improved, e.g.m in commit d0c8a3309310dff665b99097434d68873cd2cd93, where some return types are made more specific (instead of Objects returned)<br>It seems as if reorganizing the code needs mainly the first commit and the folling are for adjusting the tests as described in the ticket, which then undergo perfective changes (e.g.5787b31b0eb5391219e4ec843d90fc5b6c4ed69d and 7b98f61022e2e85d8696d081511f52a027b96ce2).<br> I do not think that it was a technical compromise to have the code organized in \"the wrong way\" earilier. It appears as this just was the \"state of mind\" of the developer(s). Also that the tests tested for expected results instead of the \"right\" operations cannot be considered a compromise in my opinion. It is more that the opinion on what should be tested and how changed now.      **Preventive Change**      | no |\n",

It seems as if most of the change is initially quite small but evolves over time into its final state. Also the feature seems non-trivial since visibility depends on authorizations.<br>I do not think that the lack of that feature was a technical compromise but more that the new feature of the Parquet Store is evolving over multiple building blocks into its full functionallity. If it was in Jira then I guess this would be a subticket to the main Parquet store ticket.  **Perfective Change**       | no |\n",

The second commit puts a similar function and test into the view. it seems from there on, the really small change is evolved and perfected into its final state, especially since the initial groupby method is moved around from view into anatoher utils class.<br>Also touches a small change to the build script (cbc253b13740d0d438aa8a11dfdcebe8feeed635). I do not understand why this is here and how is it related to the ticket.<br>Is adding docstrings in e3d5afa8075a2db5b8609db908c1b58715ffb644 a preventive change or is it just part of the normal work for the entire perfective change? <br>The contribution gets complex due to its many small changes of artifacts, I do not think it is due to a compromise but rather due to the developer talking many small steps and alos perfecting stuff on the way.**Perfective Change**       | no |\n",

Allow NamedOperations to reference each other,"At present, you cannot call one NamedOperation from inside another.  This presents a barrier to the re-use of operation chains, requires moderately complex operation chains to be longer and less readable, makes it difficult to propagate changes to commonly used code through a community, and all the other drawbacks that come with a lack of composability.

This restriction is intentional, as it allows us to avoid dealing with thorny issues such as version control of NamedOperations, the impact of propagating changes to an included operation onto the operations which include it, what happens if a user has permissions to only a subset of NamedOperations which comprise a single nested NamedOperation and so on.

However, given the benefits that could be delivered by allowing the nesting of NamedOperations, is it time to revisit this decision?",2021-04-13 10:05:40+00:00,2021-04-14 09:38:03+00:00,,open,[],2410,https://github.com/gchq/Gaffer/issues/2410,"Milestone(title=""v2_backlog"", number=110)",False,,[]

Is anyone using the Hbase Store?,"We are looking to do a number of version upgrades in Gaffer 2.0 including moving to Hadoop 3. HBase does not support Hadoop 3 out the box (it needs to be built from source using a profile). If someone is using the Hbase Store, we can take steps to include it in version 2. However, if no one is using it, we would benefit from removing support for the Hbase store until HBase releases a compatible version",2020-12-18 16:42:22+00:00,2021-04-20 16:25:38+00:00,,open,"[Label(name=""question"")]",2367,https://github.com/gchq/Gaffer/issues/2367,,False,,[]

Accumulo Store with Kerberos ,"Hi,

I have an Accumulo cluster (version: 1.7.2-cdh5.5.0) with kerberos enabled and I would like to know how I can configure Gaffer to use my Accumulo cluster as the underlying store. 

I have read the [doc](https://gchq.github.io/gaffer-doc/stores/accumulo-store.html) on Accumulo store and looked at the `TheBasics.java` from `gaffer-doc` repo (master branch). I didn't find any instructions on whether specific settings are required for kerberos. 

I downloaded the iterators.jar and distributed it to all my tservers. Then I modified `TheBasics.java` with my Accumulo properties
```java
        final AccumuloProperties properties = new AccumuloProperties();
        properties.setStoreClass(AccumuloStore.class);
        properties.setInstance(""<my_instance>"");
        properties.setZookeepers(""<my_zk1>:2181,<my_zk2>:2181,<my_zk3>:2181"");
        properties.setUser(""myuser@EXAMPLE.COM"");
        properties.setPassword(""<my_password>"");
```
And I get the following Exception
```

bugfix for gh-2239:  Merging views with global elements,"Resolves #2293 

Only expand Global* elements in a View if the schema contains an entry with that element type in.  This supports stores such as the FederatedStore where the first Store a query gets run against is in some way a proxy of some other store(s) and doesn't have the schema information to do the expansion.

Also, update the logic in updateOperationChain such that it no longer expands  a View with no entities and edges but, e.g., a globalEntities element to include all of the edges.

When reviewing, please note that I've chosen to change updateOperationChain to default scope for testing purposes and because the code didn't feel like it was perfectly encapsulated by the logic of executing a query.  Alternatively, I could change the tests to run against the public execute method (which felt a bit broad) or use reflection to test the method as a private (but I'm not sure how you feel about that 'round these parts).  Lastly, where there's identical logic for Edges and Entities, I've only included a unit for the edges part, but let me know if you want a repeated unit test for the Entities logic",2020-11-17 10:04:32+00:00,2020-11-30 10:45:37+00:00,2020-11-30 10:45:37+00:00,closed,[],2343,https://github.com/gchq/Gaffer/pull/2343,,False,,[]

Automate releases,"Releasing Gaffer is a manual process of one of the Gaffer admins changing the RELEASE_VERSION variable on travis, merging develop -> master and then closing a milestone. The actual release is taken care of by Travis CI using the deploy.sh script.

It would be better to automate this process with Github actions. We could use the milestone closure as the trigger and use the version in that milestone to do the release.

It could either use the existing deploy.sh script with some tweaking or be split into different jobs. The latter might make for a more transparent release process and better release notes as there are already a few nice example actions we can make use of.

AccessPredicate causes NamedViews/NamedOperations to fail serialisation,"Because AccessPredicate implementations don't implement Serializable there is an issue when using disk caches that rely on that mechanism. To fix this, JsonSerialise the predicates and store the strings (like we do for operation chains in the NamedOperationDetail).

To replicate, run the REST API and add a named view. It will succeed (with the below stack trace in the logs) but when the REST API reloads the NamedView will be lost as it wasn't written to disk.

Harmonise access mechanisms for Gaffer resources,"For resources such as NamedOperations and Graphs in the Federated Store, it would be really neat to harmonise and improve the way that access control is implemented. It would need to be flexible so that it can be applied to different resources. Therefore it would make sense to have a predicate that is applied to a user accessing a given resource which can be configured by more advanced users. 

For this to be accepted in Gaffer 1.x, it would need to be backwards compatible with what's already there.

The resources I'd expect this to work for are:
* NamedOperations
* NamedViews
* Graphs (Federated Store)

Doing this would make what's access control more flexible and easier to implement for any new resources.",2020-07-22 15:10:26+00:00,2020-09-04 10:52:18+00:00,2020-09-04 10:52:18+00:00,closed,"[Label(name=""enhancement""), Label(name=""headliner""), Label(name=""p:high"")]",2295,https://github.com/gchq/Gaffer/issues/2295,"Milestone(title=""v1.13.0"", number=101)",False,"NamedUser(login=""m29827"")","[NamedUser(login=""m29827"")]"

Global Elements/Edges/Entities definitions only applied when there is an explicit edge/element definition,"Combinations of globalEdges/globalEntities/globalElements and properties/groupBy/predicates do not work as intended when no explicit element definition is included.

For example:
```
{
    ""class"": ""uk.gov.gchq.gaffer.operation.impl.get.GetElements"",
    ""options"": {
        ""gaffer.federatedstore.operation.graphIds"": ""Combined_Graph""
    },
    ""view"": {
        ""globalEdges"": [
            {
                ""groupBy"": []
            }
        ]
    },
    ""input"": [...]
}
```
Returns all edges and entities without aggregation (adding allEdges/allEntities params makes no difference).

However, inheritance from global definitions does appear to work. If an explicit edge or entity is defined in the view then it will inherit from the global.

For example:
```
{
    ""class"": ""uk.gov.gchq.gaffer.operation.impl.get.GetElements"",
    ""options"": {
        ""gaffer.federatedstore.operation.graphIds"": ""Combined_Graph""
    },
    ""view"": {
        ""edges"": {
            ""<example_edge>"": {
                ""properties"": [
                    ""count""
                ]
            }
        },
        ""globalEdges"": [
            {
                ""groupBy"": []
            }
        ]
    },
    ""input"": [...]
}
```
Returns <example_edge> edges with only the ""count"" property (as expected from the explicit edge definition) but those edges are aggregated in line with the globalEdge groubBy.

Tested on a Federated Graph setup.

Response to the gh-1836-demo example.,"I have looked at the demo and taken that and other comments and reorganised the approach to the Mock to Mini Accumulo changes.
This pull request branch has only a few changes outlining how I will go about progressing gh-1836.

It was noted for the gh-1836-demo that as the Mini Accumulo Cluster should behave exactly as full Accumulo we shouldn't need any MiniAccumuloStore sub classes. This does indeed work but given the normal mechanism used by Gaffer to identify a store type is the class name specified in the properties files. This means the MiniAccumuloStore and SingleUseMiniAccumuloStore classes are needed for identification purposes, unless I have misunderstood something in this area.
The new MiniAccumuloStore class extends AccumuloStore with no changes to functionality.
The new SingleUseMiniAccumuloStore extends MiniAccumuloStore in exactly the same manner as SingleUseAccumuloStore extends AccumuloStore.
They are extended in this way rather than SingleUseMiniAccumuloStore extending SingleUseAccumuloStore to replicate the AccumuloStore object hierarchy.

Control of the decision whether to start a MiniAccumuloCluster, and the starting and stopping it, is handled by the new AccumuloTestClusterManager class. This takes an AccumuloProperties object in its constructor and reads it to find the store class. If it is a Mini Accumulo one it sets up and starts a MiniAccumuloCluster and updates the properties with the zookeeper details. If not it just returns.
Creation of the object is called at the beginning of a test suite, often through the @BeforeClass annotated method.
At the end of a test suite (@AfterClass) the close method is called to close and tidy away the Mini Accumulo Cluster if one has been started. The test suite will have kept the reference to the AccumuloTestClusterManager object for this purpose.

There are three tests converted from using Mock to Mini:
AccumuloStoreITs from the demo is suitably modified to use the new AccumuloTestClusterManager. This is slightly odd looking as for this test the constructors receive the properties. This prevents use of the @BeforeClass as that has to be a static method so cannot use instance attributes.
GetDataFrameOfElementsHandlerTest is a spark-accumulo test that was constructed to set up its store only from properties. This was among the tests that previously had a lot of duplicated code. They will now have an abstract superclass, AbstractPropertiesDrivenTest, to handle most of the repeating setup.
AccumuloStoreTest is an example of the most common types of unit tests. This had explicit Mock handling as part of the tests, in some cases with SingleUseMockAccumuloStore being instantiated by individual tests. This has been converted to reuse of a pair of mini accumulo clusters for all the tests.

In all the test examples above I have avoided declaration of the MiniAccumuloStore and SingleUseMiniAccumuloStore classes as far as possible, instead having any necessary Store declarations being for AccumuloStore.

Is this closer to what was expected?",2020-06-22 13:14:17+00:00,2020-06-23 11:02:15+00:00,2020-06-23 11:02:15+00:00,closed,[],2286,https://github.com/gchq/Gaffer/pull/2286,,False,,[]

Interestingly the REST API doesn't throw such an exception when pointing it at the same directory. Took a look and found that this is because the REST API loads the schema by [calling Graph.Builder().addSchema(Path)](https://github.com/gchq/Gaffer/blob/48579e1e3ff18bfa846a053c2e5603819f9753e4/rest-api/core-rest/src/main/java/uk/gov/gchq/gaffer/rest/factory/DefaultGraphFactory.java#L117).

Gh 2249 accumulo upgrade to 1.9.3,"Hi - I've made the changes for Accumulo 1.9.3:

- I've added new tests for the `rfilereaderrdd` package in JUnit5 to help increase the coverage and to manage any changes in behaviour after upgrading
- Also refactored some of the existing tests and upgraded to JUnit5 to use some of the newer features
- I fixed the compiler errors RFileReaderIterator caused by updating the Accumulo version to 1.9.3
- I ran the integration tests locally against a MiniAccumulo cluster I ran locally and all passed
- I also updated the README how to set up integration tests on a local cluster to help future developers/users

I can add more tests and increase the coverage in the modules that consume the Accumulo dependency? - I wasn't sure how far to go with it so thought I'd raise the pull request anyway and see what you think - I'm don't mind writing more.

Also let me know of any other recommendations/changes you require for this or if you run any additional Accumulo tests of your own that picks something? 

Cheers",2020-03-19 16:49:25+00:00,2020-03-30 12:50:25+00:00,2020-03-30 12:50:25+00:00,closed,[],2261,https://github.com/gchq/Gaffer/pull/2261,,False,,[]

Create an operation to set split points on an Accumulo store from an RDD or JavaRDD of Elements,"It's possible to import an `RDD` of `Element`s to an Accumulo store, but there's no easy way to set the split points on a store given an RDD. We should create an operation for adding the split points to a store given an `RDD<Element>` or `JavaRDD<Element>` and write a handler for this operation for the Accumulo store.

The code will be something like:

    JavaRDD<Element> elements = ...
    byte[] schemaAsJson = schema.toCompactJson();
    FlatMapFunction<Iterator<Element>, Pair<Key,Key>> generateKeys = new FlatMapFunction<>() {
        AccumuloElementConverter converter;
        @Override
        public Iterator<Pair<Key,Key>> call(Iterator<Element> elementIterator) throws Exception {
             converter = Class.forName(converterClassName).asSubclass(AccumuloElementConverter.class)
                   .getConstructor(Schema.class)
                   .newInstance(Schema.fromJson(schemaAsjson);
             return new Iterator<Pair<Key,Key>> {
                  @Override
                  public boolean hasNext() { return elementIterator.hasNext(); }
                  public Pair<Key,Key> next() { return converter.getKeysFromElement(elementIterator.next());
        }
    };
    JavaRDD<Text> rows = elements.mapPartitions(generateKeys)
        .flatMap(pair -> {
              if (null == pair.getSecond()) {return Arrays.asList(pair.getFirst()).iterator();}
              else {return Arrays.asList(pair.getFirst(), pair.getSecond()).iterator();}
        })
        .map(key -> key.getRow());

This RDD can now be sampled using `.sample()` and then collected to a local list. This list can then be used to set the split points on the table. It may be necessary to count the number of rows to determine an appropriate sampling proportion so that approximately the right number of split points can be sampled.",2020-03-10 14:04:17+00:00,2020-04-20 08:09:38+00:00,2020-04-20 08:09:38+00:00,closed,"[Label(name=""enhancement""), Label(name=""p:normal"")]",2257,https://github.com/gchq/Gaffer/issues/2257,"Milestone(title=""v1.12.0"", number=100)",False,"NamedUser(login=""m29827"")","[NamedUser(login=""m29827"")]"
Add GroupedProperties to Kryo Registrator,"For some Spark operations it would be useful for GroupedProperties to be Kryo serialisable. This will be needed for issue #989.

As serialising GroupedProperties normally needs the Schema, and the current Registrator does not allow passing in options that are only known at run time, the easiest way to do it seems to be to create a GroupedPropertiesKryoSerializer that writes data using:

    output.writeString(groupedProperties.getGroup());
    Serializer s = kryo.getSerializer(Properties.class);
    s.write(kryo, output, (Properties) groupedProperties);

and reads it back in using:

    String group = input.readString();
    Serializer s = kryo.getSerializer(Properties.class);
    Properties properties = (Properties) s.read(kryo, input, Properties.class);
    GroupedProperties groupedProperties = new GroupedProperties(group);
    groupedProperties.putAll(properties);

Expand the library of functions for Gaffer types,"Functions such as:

- ToTrailingWildcardPair (produces a Pair of EntityIds to allow a follow on query using the GetElementsInRanges operation. Implements KorypheFunction<Object, Pair<EntityId, EntityId>>. Allows the user to provide the end of the range (defaults to `~`). For example, takes the String 'value1' and the end of the range `'~'` and produces `new Pair(new EntitySeed('value1'), new EntitySeed('value1~'))`.

JSONSerialiser unable handle some primitive data types and throws Unrecognized token error.,"JSONSerialisation is unable to serialise some primitive types and causes errors.

This can occurring between proxied stores. A store may return a Long value and the receiving store is unable to deserialise correctly.

To replicate the bug.
Examine `IfIT.java` and tests `ShouldReturnOriginalInputWhenConditionIsFalseAndNoOtherwise` and `ShouldReturnOriginalInputWhenConditionIsTrueAndNoThen`. examine lines containing `//This test input has been changed to an integer to avoid triggering a bug JSONSerialisation.`

Change for both test:
`ifOperation.setInput(404);` to `ifOperation.setInput(INPUT_CAMEL_CASE);`
`new IsA(""java.lang.String"")));` to `new IsA(""java.lang.Integer"")));`
`assertEquals(404, output);` to `assertEquals(INPUT_CAMEL_CASE, output);`
` assertTrue(output instanceof Integer);` to  `assertTrue(output instanceof String);`

and error will occur when you run the `ProxyStoreITs` (make it easier on yourself add `singleTest(IfIT.class);` to this class temporarily do no push this change.)

This errors with `OperationException: Unrecognized token 'AbCd': was expecting ('true', 'false' or 'null')`

MaskTimestampSetByTimeRange is not flexible,"MaskTimestampSetByTimeRange only accepts Longs as input. It should be able to use any Number implementation.

This would change how the current time range is json serialised:
```json
{
    ""startTime"": 20,
    ""endTime"": 30
}
```
It should generate 20 and 30 as Integers, rather than Longs. To specify Longs, you would have to wrap the value:
```json
{
    ""startTime"": {
        ""java.lang.Long"": 20
    },
    ""endTime"": {
        ""java.lang.Long"": 30
    }
}
```
As we are dealing with timestamps there is a high chance that they will be outside the range of integers (especially if they are given in smaller time units). In the event this happens, the function should deserialise the value as a long. If this is not handled, it will be a breaking change and will therefore have to wait for v2.0.0 to be implemented.",2019-06-11 09:34:21+00:00,2021-04-20 16:29:55+00:00,,open,"[Label(name=""enhancement""), Label(name=""p:low"")]",2172,https://github.com/gchq/Gaffer/issues/2172,"Milestone(title=""v2_backlog"", number=110)",False,,[]

I'm raising this issue to follow on from the discussion on chat, the outcomes of which are:
* The allowed characters for the graphId were limited because of an issue with using '.' for the Parquet store
* Namespaces in accumulo lets you grant namespace level permissions to a user (https://static.javadoc.io/org.apache.accumulo/accumulo-core/1.8.0/org/apache/accumulo/core/security/NamespacePermission.html). That means you could create a namespace and grant your write user permission to create tables only in that namespace rather than having to grant them system level permission instead (ie System.CREATE_TABLE) 
* The namespace option should be added to accumulo store properties

SchemaElementDefinition is not thread-safe,"`SchemaElementDefinition` is not thread-safe. The method `getIngestAggregator` can cause this exception if it is called by two methods at the same time:

This seems to the reason the CI tests for the Parquet store fail randomly (see https://github.com/gchq/Gaffer/pull/2147).

The methods `getFullAggregator` and `getQueryAggregator` have the same problem.

This is marked as a bug because the Javadoc does not say that these methods are not thread-safe.

Possible solutions:

- Mark these methods as `synchronized`. This is a simple fix (it solved the problem with the occasional failures in the CI for the Parquet store). This may reduce the performance of this method. We could look for all uses of these methods and ensure that the caller caches the result for re-use.
- Add a comment to the Javadoc for `SchemaElementDefinition` to say that they are not thread-safe, and change the code in the Parquet store that uses them to avoid the synchronisation problem. Downside - in future code we may get errors due to them not being thread-safe.
- Calculate the ingest and full aggregators when the `SchemaElementDefinition` class is created and then just return them. This isn't possible for the query aggregator though as that depends on parameters passed into the method.",2019-05-13 15:31:19+00:00,2019-06-05 11:49:12+00:00,2019-06-05 11:49:06+00:00,closed,"[Label(name=""bug""), Label(name=""p:high"")]",2159,https://github.com/gchq/Gaffer/issues/2159,"Milestone(title=""v1.10.0-RC1"", number=90)",False,,[]

Scheduled Jobs are unnecessarily hard to create.,"Scheduled Jobs are overly complicated to create as it requires the user to provide the operation chain as a string.

ParquetStore tests aren't descriptive and contain incorrect logic,"Some test methods in AbstractOperationsTest class, such as ""getElementsWithPostAggregationFilterTest"" and ""getElementsWithPostTransformFilterTest"" have fairly misleading names, and the test logic is not clear, concise, nor does it often directly relate to the test name.

Join operation does not allow merging of different groups,"Currently, the Join operation (with an Element Matcher and Merger) behaves like a schema aggregator. It merges two elements of the same group using the schema and given group by properties. However a typical SQL Join would be able to join rows of different tables.

The best way to change this would be to change how the matcher works, and make the Merger optional. The matcher should take two functions to apply to each of the iterables on the left and output of the right, then compare the results to determine what is a match.

If the matcher returned a Map Tuple containing the key, the left side matches and right side matches, then we could perform a Map operation afterwards to select the relevant properties/elements and manipulate the output.

This could replace the Merger to reduce complexity of the Join operation.

Furthermore, to avoid a performance hit, any Joins which require iterating over both the left and right hand side (Full and Full Outer) will be removed.",2019-02-26 13:11:32+00:00,2019-03-07 16:50:54+00:00,2019-03-06 11:21:08+00:00,closed,"[Label(name=""enhancement""), Label(name=""intermediate""), Label(name=""migration-required""), Label(name=""p:high"")]",2101,https://github.com/gchq/Gaffer/issues/2101,"Milestone(title=""v1.8.1"", number=85)",False,"NamedUser(login=""d47853"")","[NamedUser(login=""d47853"")]"

Publish and Subscribe Operations,"With the proxy store and federated store I can run a query on one Gaffer graph and write the results into another. 

When i do this, I move all of the data via the ""client"" that interacts with the federated store - which can be slow if the ""client"" is single threaded or a network bottleneck.

Many Gaffer queries read or write to an Iterable of objects. If i could post the objects on this iterable to a Kafka queue for example and then read it off again I could execute operation chains efficiently across  different graphs in different locations.

To do this, we need a Publish operation that takes the result of a Gaffer operation and posts it to an endpoint, and a Subscribe operation that reads from an endpoint into a Gaffer operation.

For example, I can run GetAllElements on Graph_1, Publish the resulting iterable to a Kafka Queue ""endpoint"", then run Subscribe on the endpoint and submit the resulting iterable of Elements to an AddElements on Graph_2. This could be executed as a single op-chain.",2018-11-23 13:59:16+00:00,2018-11-23 13:59:16+00:00,,open,"[Label(name=""advanced""), Label(name=""needs-elaboration""), Label(name=""p:low"")]",1957,https://github.com/gchq/Gaffer/issues/1957,,False,,[]

checkstyle AvoidNestedBlocks ,"Can we remove AvoidNestedBlocks from check style.xml ?

I find it is a useful way to block item of code together and remove objects from scope within methods which sometimes may not require fully extracting out into another method.

int i ;
{    int temp = i;
    temp = method(temp)
    i+=temp 
}
//continue with i while temp is now out of scope.

maybe sometimes its useful to see whats happening with temp without pulling the logic out.
As future work develops as temp logic increases complexity then its already blocked off and can easily be pulled out as a method in future.",2018-11-20 17:17:09+00:00,2018-11-20 17:27:02+00:00,2018-11-20 17:26:34+00:00,closed,"[Label(name=""question""), Label(name=""vote-required"")]",1950,https://github.com/gchq/Gaffer/issues/1950,,False,"NamedUser(login=""GCHQDeveloper404"")","[NamedUser(login=""GCHQDeveloper404"")]"

There's an issue with generic invariance on the Java 8 implementation of the `Stream#reduce(BinaryOperator<T> binaryOperator)` method.

A workaround is to ""coerce"" the types of objects in the stream into the target type by using the three argument `reduce(U identity, BiFunction<U,? super T,U> accumulator, BinaryOperator<U> combiner)` method.

Unable to federate over 2 graphs that have different visibility properties,"If you create 2 graphs in the FederatedStore with different visibility property names (""visibility1"" and ""visibility2"") then you cannot run a single operation over both graphs at the same time.

Signature of methods in SchemaElementDefinition,"In `SchemaElementDefinition` the signature of the method `getGroupBy` is to return `Set<String>`. The actual object that is returned is of type `LinkedHashSet`. Many callers of this method assume that the results are in a consistent order, e.g. when properties are serialised they need to always be serialised in the same order. As the result is a `LinkedHashSet`, the results are in a consistent order. But as the signature doesn't guarantee that, in theory the implementation of `SchemaElementDefinition` could change (to return a `HashSet` for example) and client code would break as the order would not be consistent.

There are similar issues with `getIdentifierMap` and `getProperties`.

If we think that the only callers of these methods are internal to Gaffer then we can just update the signature. If not, then we can deprecate these methods and replace them with ones that guarantee a consistent order and update all the callers of the methods in Gaffer to use the new ones.",2018-05-24 13:50:59+00:00,2018-12-12 12:31:45+00:00,,open,"[Label(name=""enhancement""), Label(name=""p:low"")]",1804,https://github.com/gchq/Gaffer/issues/1804,"Milestone(title=""Backlog"", number=12)",False,,[]
Possible bug in AccumuloKeyRangePartitioner,"The `getSplits` method in `AccumuloKeyRangePartitioner` gets the splits from Accumulo and then stores them in an array of Strings. The line

    splits.parallelStream().map(Text::toString).collect(Collectors.toList()).toArray(arr)

uses `parallelStream` which means that possibly the results won't be in the same order as the input. It's essential that they are sorted as `Arrays.binarySearch` is called on the result which requires that the array is sorted.

Related to this, the line

    final Collection<Text> splits = connector.tableOperations().listSplits(table);

shows that the result of `listSplits` is a `Collection`. In practice this is probably always returned sorted, but the signature (and Javadoc) does not guarantee that. It may be safer to explicitly sort the `splits`.",2018-05-24 13:33:33+00:00,2018-09-20 13:49:50+00:00,2018-09-20 13:49:44+00:00,closed,"[Label(name=""bug""), Label(name=""p:normal"")]",1803,https://github.com/gchq/Gaffer/issues/1803,"Milestone(title=""1.7.0-RC2"", number=76)",False,"NamedUser(login=""m55624"")","[NamedUser(login=""m55624"")]"

Deprecate the seedMatching option on Operations,"The seed matching option allows users to define whether they want Edges/Entities that are 'equal to' or 'related to' their seeds.

For Edge Seeds, the matching types determines whether to return just the Edges that have the same src/dest/direction as the Edge seed or also return the Entities either end of the edge seeds.

Allow users to configure which walks are returned in a GetWalks operation,"Currently GetWalks only returns full walks. In some cases users may also want to return partial walks.
For example if you do 4 hops you may want to return an walks that are length 3 or length 4.

In this case:
1 - 2 - 3 - 4
1 - 5 - 6
We should not return the walk 1 - 2 - 3 as we will return the length 4 walk instead.

To achieve this we should add a new field to the GetWalks operation. This field should allow users to configure the types of Walks that are returned. Perhaps this field could be an object that contains a transform Operation and a Predicate, similar to the Conditional object used in If and While. We would need to pass test Walk objects to the transform/predicate so that we can test whether or not we return it. 

By default we should continue to only return full walks.

The reducer is configured to use the Accumulo key, which includes the timestamp. As the timestamp is set to a random number, no elements will have the same key and therefore no aggregation will occur. This will put a lot of load on Accumulo to aggregate the elements and causes a lot of unnecessary data to be passed around.",2018-03-22 14:25:12+00:00,2018-04-03 11:13:39+00:00,2018-03-22 17:18:35+00:00,closed,"[Label(name=""invalid"")]",1739,https://github.com/gchq/Gaffer/issues/1739,,False,,[]

Accumulo store may skip over similar non-aggregated elements,"There is a 'limitation' in Accumulo where you can't have 'many' rows with the same Key. When you scan over the rows, the scanner reads the data in batches. After the first batch Accumulo tries to work out where to restart the scan and will skip over rows that have a key equal to one already read. To fix this we will set the timestamp to a random number for non aggregated groups. Aggregated elements work already as the elements with the same key are aggregated together, so there are never duplicate rows with the same key.",2018-03-22 11:31:14+00:00,2018-04-05 07:41:17+00:00,2018-03-23 10:13:57+00:00,closed,"[Label(name=""bug""), Label(name=""headliner""), Label(name=""p:high"")]",1737,https://github.com/gchq/Gaffer/issues/1737,"Milestone(title=""v1.4.0-RC4"", number=62)",False,"NamedUser(login=""p013570"")","[NamedUser(login=""p013570"")]"

Allow Federated Graphs to be disabled/enabled,"Currently in the FederatedStore, if you execute a GetElements operation you can specify which graphs to execute the operation on using the graphId operation option.

To fix this, we could 'enable' all graphs by default and also allow users to add graphs that are 'disabled' by default.

Should we attempt to make Gaffer a more general purpose framework?,"Gaffer offers a lot more than just a graph database, you get quite a lot of functionality out of the box and on the other hand a lot of normal graph operations are not included (shortest path, page rank, etc.). It is likely that someone may want to use some of Gaffer's functionality without wanted to store their data in a graph format. Currently you can actually use Gaffer without any Edges, i.e just rows in a table, indexed by a single id (the vertex), but this isn’t very obvious.

Here are some of Gaffer's features that could be reused independent of it being a graph database:
- NamedOperations (and NamedViews)
- Job Tracker (basic implementation)
- Operations and handlers
- Pluggable components
- Aggregation/summarisation
- Age off/continuous validation
- Graph hooks
- REST API
- UI
- Python shell

When you start using Gaffer a lot of the above features are optional and can be independently enabled/disabled, so I don’t think we necessarily need to split these components up any further. 

If someone wants to use Gaffer purely for the operation/handler api then we/they could implement a new Store that does not implement Get/Add and just register any custom operations and handlers - perhaps we should actually create a store for this purpose now?

I guess what we could do is remove/decouple any references to ‘graph' in our core libraries. This would involve things like:
- Rename Graph to GafferConnector
- Rename GraphHooks to Hooks
- Rename GraphLibrary to GafferLibrary
- In the UI we could easily hide the Graph view if there are no Edges in the schema. Leaving just the query builder and table view.
- Regarding the Schema, we have a couple of options (similarly with Views)
  - Just leave it as it is, but highlight that Edges aren’t required (likewise Entities aren’t required). 
  - Remove Edges from the Schema and create a GraphSchema that extends Schema and adds Edges.
  - Try to make the Element class more generic so it has a list of IDs. Entities would then just have a single vertex ID and Edges would have source, destination and directed IDs.

Provide a way for Gaffer graphs to be migrated/versioned,"Currently Gaffer doesn't really handle migrating and versioning, you need to handle this yourself. You are able to add new properties, change aggregators and in HBase/Accumulo you can rename properties in the schema. Other changes such as removing/reordering properties, changing serialisers or property types, renaming groups is difficult to do and we don't currently provide any help for doing this.

For large graphs it may not be possible/feasible to attempt to migrate all your data so we should provide the ability for a new version of the schema to be used and allow queries to be automatically adapted to run against the new and the old data, aggregating the results.

It would be nice if we could provide an automated way to handle migrations or at least some documentation explaining how we suggest it should be done.

### Some thoughts

If you simply want to change the type of a property:

Schema v1 (the current schema):
```
BasicEdge
  - property1 (int)
```

Schema v2 (the new schema):
```
BasicEdge
 - property1 (long)
```

 The idea would be that Gaffer would merge these schemas together to form something like:
```
BasicEdge
 - property1 (in)

BasicEdge|2
 - property1 (long)
```

Ingesters would need to be updated to start populating BasicEdge|2 instead of the original BasicEdge group.

When a query is executed, it now needs to be adapted to query for both BasicEdge and BasicEdge|2 and we need to apply a conversion to allow these 2 different types of edges to be merged together. This conversion should be supplied by a sys admin, in the form of a mapping json file, detailing how the migration from version1 to version 2 should be carried out. In this case a a transform function that casts an int into a long would be sufficient. More complex migrations that involve new properties, deleting properties could be carried out in a similar way.

If the Graph is configured to age data off after a period of time, then after some time when all the BasicEdge edges have been deleted, this migration can be removed and users would be able to query directly for the new EdgeGroup|2 group.

This process would have an impact on performance as we would need to aggregate the BasicEdge edges with BasicEdge|2 edges at query time. This could be pushed down to Accumulo, but that could be optimised later in a separate issue.

I think this mapping could all be done via a GraphHook. The difficulty would be working out which predicates could be pushed down to Accumulo and which ones have to be done after the extra query time migration aggregation is carried out. 
This could be something like:
- Leave the PreAggFilters as they are 
- PostAggFilters, Transforms and PostTransformFilters would need to be 'deleted'. 
- Run the query
- Apply any extra migration aggregation that is required
- Then apply the original PostAggFilters, Transforms and PostTransformFilters.

The above logic could be skipped if the query doesn't contain any groups that have been migration.

NPE in AccumuloStoreRelation,"The following code in the `buildScan(final String[] requiredColumns, final Filter[] filters)` method in `AccumuloStoreRelation` can throw a `NullPointerException`:

The `getOperation` method on `FiltersToOperationConverter` can return null if it identifies that the filters it is passed will always result in no results. This can be seen by running `df.filter(""group = 'abc'"")` where `abc` is not a group in the schema and `df` is a DataFrame obtained by running the `GetDataFrameOfElements` method. To fix this the `operation.setOptions(options)` call should be moved to after the null check and a unit test added to check that an empty DataFrame is returned when the above filter is applied.",2017-12-20 15:14:59+00:00,2018-01-11 14:48:17+00:00,2018-01-11 14:48:17+00:00,closed,"[Label(name=""bug""), Label(name=""p:normal"")]",1605,https://github.com/gchq/Gaffer/issues/1605,"Milestone(title=""v1.3.0-RC1"", number=52)",False,"NamedUser(login=""m607123"")","[NamedUser(login=""m607123"")]"
Converter should be used to get group from key in AccumuloStore,"This is similar to #1535.

In `AggregatorIterator` in the Accumulo store, the group is obtained from the key using

    group = new String(key.getColumnFamilyData().getBackingArray(), CommonConstants.UTF_8)

This should be done by using the `elementConverter`.

The group is obtained from the key in the `getEdgeFromKey` method in `AbstractCoreKeyAccumuloElementConverter` using the same approach.

Gh 1507 graphframe element generator,"Initial ideas for converting a GraphFrame (or a DataFrame) to an Iterable of Element objects. The implementation here uses two operations to achieve this:

* GraphFrameToIterable
* GenerateElements (with a RowToElementGenerator)

Unfortunately it's not straightforward to use a generator as is, since the bulk of the generators in Gaffer at the moment are geared up for converting Iterable<OBJ> -> Iterable<Element>. So in order to use the existing generator-based approach, the GraphFrame must be first converted into an Iterable<Row>.

There are a few caveats here based on some limitations of the use of DataFrames:

* All elements are pulled into a single DataFrame/GraphFrame, so it will not always be possible to distinguish between edge properties and entity properties. If an edge group and an entity group are present that share a property name, it will not always be possible to reconstruct the original elements - these properties must be of the same type (this is noted in the AccumuloStoreRelation javadoc).
* The implementation relies on the use of several reserved words (src, dst, id, vertex etc). If any of these words are used as property names, then this approach will not work.

Any suggestions would be welcome - should we stick with using a Generator approach or shall I wrap these into a single operation?

HBase store deduplicates elements that have the same key and timestamp,"The HBase store will normally default this value for you to the current system time in milliseconds.
If you add 2 elements within the same millisecond that have the same Key then the elements will be deduplicated.

This can also happen if you have set the ""timestampProperty"" field in your schema and you manually populate the timestamp property yourself. You would need to ensure the timestamps are different.

This bug is caused by the versioning iterator in HBase deduplicating the elements. In Accumulo, we are able to disable the versioning iterator so we don't have this problem.

To solve this we recommend you don't populate the timestamp field yourself and let the HBase store do it for you. Rather than just defaulting it to the current time we will add an element of randomness to the value. This will mean the timestamp value will no longer represent time, it will just be a random number.",2017-11-29 13:17:19+00:00,2017-12-14 08:49:46+00:00,2017-12-07 11:15:12+00:00,closed,"[Label(name=""bug""), Label(name=""headliner""), Label(name=""p:high"")]",1565,https://github.com/gchq/Gaffer/issues/1565,"Milestone(title=""v1.2.0-RC1"", number=47)",False,"NamedUser(login=""p013570"")","[NamedUser(login=""p013570"")]"

AddElementsFromHdfs deduplicates Elements that have aggregation disabled and identical keys,"Hi again,

I'm still looking at the netflow data I've mentioned in other questions. I specified in the schema that Netflow edges are not to be aggregated and each edge represents a single netflow event in the original csv with probably different properties.

When I use the startTime property as the timestamp (I have to nano precision, but storing at millis), only one record is stored in accumulo even if I have >1 record with the same source+destination+timestamp. I've also tried using the default timestamp and this is resulting in more missing records. I've checked the element generator, and all the elements are being generated correctly.

Here is some example records from the CTU13 dataset (previously mentioned) that demonstrates the problem.
These two records have the same source (::) and destination (ff02::1:ff97:a3eb), and the timestamps both map to 2011/08/12 15:59:53.173 (converted to a long), and only the first one was in accumulo
```
[2011/08/12 15:59:53.173326,0.0,ipv6-icmp,::,130,   ->,ff02::1:ff97:a3eb,null,MRQ,0,null,1,86,86,flow=Background]
[2011/08/12 15:59:53.173341,90.500267,ipv6-icmp,::,135,   ->,ff02::1:ff97:a3eb,null,NNS,0,null,6,468,468,flow=Background]
```
These two records have the same source (::) and destination (ff02::1:ff9d:312f), and the timestamps map to different values: 2011/08/12 16:09:48.275 and 2011/08/12 16:09:48.276, and both records are in accumulo
```
[2011/08/12 16:09:48.275895,0.500047,ipv6-icmp,::,135,   ->,ff02::1:ff9d:312f,null,NNS,0,null,2,156,156,flow=Background]

```

Do you have any suggestions about how I can change my config / ingest to ensure that all my events are stored separately?

The Flink GafferSink add elements queue could run out of memory,"The implementation of `AddElementsFromKafkaHandler` that uses Flink to add data from Kafka contains some code that looks unnecessarily complicated and there's no Javadoc to explain why it's done this way:

- The `invoke` method on `GafferSink` receives an `Iterable` of `Element`s. This will normally be a small batch of `Element`s created from a single Kafka entry. Presumably this is passed to a `GafferSink` which passes it to a `GafferAdder` to avoid the expense of creating an `AddElements` operation for each small batch. If a `flatMap` was called after the `map` in `doOperation` in `AddElementsFromKafkaHandler` then the sink would receive a never-ending iterable of elements which could be passed to a single `AddElement`s operation - only one of these would ever need to be created. There would be no need for a `GafferAdder`.
- The `GafferAdder` maintains a `ConcurrentLinkedQueue` of elements. It looks like it's assumed that elements will be continually added to the queue whilst the `AddElements` operation is simultaneously running and pulling data from it. This means that if the `AddElements` operation is slower than the ingest from Kafka (e.g. because Accumulo is under load) then it will eventually run out of memory, i.e. there is no way of back pressure being applied to earlier functions in the stream. There should be a test to check that back pressure is applied.

If the design is correct then there should be some Javadoc to explain why it's done this way.

Improve GetDataframeOfElementsHandler for Parquet store,"The `GetDataframeOfElementsHandler` for the Parquet store doesn't take advantage of the partitioning and sorting. This means that a query such as ""select * where vertex=A"" has to read a lot more data than is necessary.

Improved approach to loading data into Parquet store from Accumulo store,"Data can currently be loaded from an Accumulo store into a Parquet store by using a `GetRDDOfAllElements` operation followed by an `ImportRDDOfElements` operation. This approach does not take advantage of the sorting of the Accumulo data. The elements are written out to a temporary directory, and then resorted.

It would be better to take each Accumulo tablet and write that out as sorted Parquet files. Each tablet contains 3 types of key-value corresponding to Entitys, ""forward"" edges and ""backwards"" edges. These would be written out to different Parquet files (under the group=G/ directories for entities and forwards edges or under the sorted-by-destination directory for backwards edges). These files would already be sorted and partitioned. This should significantly speed up ingest into the Parquet store from the Accumulo store. The resulting files may not be uniformly sized, e.g. if there is an Accumulo tablet containing only edges out of a single high-degree vertex, but this is probably a trade worth making if the ingest time is improved.

This approach should take advantage of the option to directly read RFiles in `GetRDDOfAllElements` as this means the export can be done without imposing additional load on Accumulo's tablet servers.",2017-10-20 09:37:42+00:00,2019-02-11 16:40:42+00:00,,open,"[Label(name=""advanced""), Label(name=""enhancement""), Label(name=""p:normal""), Label(name=""parquet"")]",1464,https://github.com/gchq/Gaffer/issues/1464,"Milestone(title=""Backlog"", number=12)",False,,[]

Create Operations interface for an Operation that has nested Operations,"Currently the only operation that has nested operations is OperationChain. However, in the future there may be more like Path #1301.

In Graph and GraphHooks we do various processing that recursively applies logic to all operations. If the operation has nested operations then we also need to apply the logic to those operations too. At the moment we do a check if(op instanceof OperationChain) then apply the logic to all nested operations.

To allow for operations like Path in the future we should create an interface like:

interface Operations<OP extends Operation> {
      Collection< OP> getOperations();
}

Then OperationChain and Path can implement this interface.

Throughout the code where we recursively look up nested operations we can now check if the Operation is an instance of Operations instead of using OperationChain. The main places in the code base to update are:
- AddOperationsToChain.addOperationsToChain

Operation Views are not automatically set on nested OperationChains,"If you execute an operation chain like:

```json
{
   ""class"": ""uk.gov.gchq.gaffer.operation.OperationChain"",
   ""operations"": [
      {
         ""class"": ""uk.gov.gchq.gaffer.operation.OperationChain"",
         ""operations"": [
            {
               ""class"": ""uk.gov.gchq.gaffer.operation.impl.get.GetAllElements""
            },
            {
               ""class"": ""uk.gov.gchq.gaffer.operation.impl.Limit"",
               ""resultLimit"": 1,
               ""truncate"": true
            }
         ]
      }
   ]
}
```

Then the view in GetAllElements is not populated by the Graph and left as null. The store implementations assume that the View will never be null, so this will cause a null pointer exception to be thrown at some point in the Stores logic. For example on Accumulo:

```
java.lang.NullPointerException

```


The fix is quite simple. In the Graph.updateOperationChainView method we need to recursively call updateOperationChainView for any operation that is an instance of OperationChain.

Something like:

```java
private void updateOperationChainView(final OperationChain<?> operationChain) {
    for (final Operation operation : operationChain.getOperations()) {
        if (operation instanceof OperationChain) {
            updateOperationChainView(((OperationChain) operation));
        } else if (operation instanceof OperationView) {
            final OperationView operationView = (OperationView) operation;
            final View opView;
            if (null == operationView.getView()) {
                opView = config.getView();
            } else if (!operationView.getView().hasGroups()) {
                opView = new View.Builder()
                        .merge(config.getView())
                        .merge(operationView.getView())
                        .build();
            } else {
                opView = operationView.getView();
            }

            opView.expandGlobalDefinitions();
            operationView.setView(opView);
        }
    }
}
```

and we would need some unit tests to check this.

API report for GCHQ Graph,"Hi,

Here is the report on API changes and backward binary compatibility for the GCHQ Graph library: https://abi-laboratory.pro/java/tracker/timeline/gchq-graph/

The report is generated by the https://github.com/lvc/japi-compliance-checker tool for jars at http://central.maven.org/maven2/uk/gov/gchq/gaffer/graph/ according to https://wiki.eclipse.org/Evolving_Java-based_APIs_2.

Hope it will be helpful for users and maintainers of the library to be aware of past and future API changes.

The tool checks all public API methods and classes. Please let me know if it should not check some parts of the API.

Please also let me know if you'd like to see more components of the library in the tracker.

Thank you.

Custom scores in NamedOperations,"We have a GraphHook called OperationChainLimiter, that limits the combination of operations that are allowed to be executed at the same time.

Each operation can be given a score and when an operation chain is executed the scores for each operation is summed. The total score for the operation chain is then compared against an allowed maximum score for the given user.

This works well for normal operations. Named Operations and potentially other operations in the future may need to have a variable score depending on how it is configured. So it would be useful to have another interface:

```java
public interface ScoreResolver {
    int getScore(final Operation operation);
}
```

AddNamedOperation needs to be updated to take an optional extra field 'score' that should be persisted in the Named Operation Cache. We would then need to write a NamedOperationScoreResolver that looks up the score for the NamedOperation in the Named Operation Cache. If the Named Operation does not have a score then return null and the score can be resolved by the default mechanism in ScoreOperationChainHandler.

We would then need to configure ScoreOperationChainHandler to have a map of Operation class to implementation of ScoreResolver. If the operation is not in this map then we can just default to using the configured opScores map.

Question: Operation specific config not being read ,"hi again :)

I'm trying to add trace logging when I run my operation without affecting everyone else's, but it seems to just use whatever the defaults are. I've traced through and it looks like when it's deserialising the custom config stored at Hadoop_Configuration_Key in the operation, it reads -17 as the length and then ignores any of the config. Am I doing something wrong? Is there some other way of adding custom config?

The code I'm using is below: 

```
val customhadoopconffile = new FileInputStream(""/path/to/myconf.xml"")
val conf = new Configuration()
conf.addResource(customhadoopconffile)
val baos = new ByteArrayOutputStream()
val dataoutput = new DataOutputStream(baos)
conf.write(dataoutput)
val myhadoopconf = new String(baos.toByteArray(), ""UTF-8"")

...

val operation = new GetRDDOfElements.Builder().input(new EntitySeed(""0.0.0.0"")).option(""Hadoop_Configuration_Key"", myhadoopconf).sparkContext(sc).build()
```

myconf.xml is:
```
<?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8"" standalone=""no""?><configuration>
  <property>
    <name>AccumuloInputFormat.GeneralOpts.LogLevel</name>
    <value>5000</value>

Read time to spark RDD is slow,"hi,
I'm using Gaffer to store data in Accumulo, and then reading out as a spark RDD using the provided  operations (eg GetAllRDDOfElements). Reading the data into an RDD seems to be really slow - it takes 2 hours to read 20 million records off a single node. No doubt some of it comes down to our hardware, but is this your experience as well?

gh-1135 - updated doc for ordered serialisers,"##### Serialisers
Gaffer will automatically choose serialisers for you for some core types.
Where possible you should let Gaffer choose for you, as it will choose the optimal
serialiser for the type and your usage.

For custom types you will need to write your own serialiser. When manually
choosing a serialiser for your schema you will need to take the following into
consideration.

For vertex serialisation and groupBy properties you must choose serialisers that
are consistent. A consistent serialiser will serialise the equal objects into
exactly the same values (bytes). For example the JavaSerialiser and
FreqMapSerialiser are not consistent.

When using an ordered store (a store that implements the ORDERED StoreTrait),
this includes Accumulo and HBase, you need to check whether the serialisers are
ordered.

 - for vertex serialisation you must use a serialiser that is ordered
 - for groupBy properties we recommend using a serialiser that is ordered, however it is not essential. In fact it will not cause any problems at present. In the future we plan to add features that would only be available to you if your groupBy properties are serialised using ordered serialisers.
 - all other properties can be serialised with ordered/unordered serialisers.",2017-08-13 14:16:00+00:00,2017-08-14 11:06:10+00:00,2017-08-14 11:06:06+00:00,closed,[],1189,https://github.com/gchq/Gaffer/pull/1189,,False,,[]

Improve Ingest for Parquet store from RDD,"Currently with the ingest process for very large volumes of data, the aggregation job can take a long time.

- write out the unsorted data into folders for each range of vertex and src values
- aggregate each folder adding in the existing corresponding data (This will prevent the whole lot of data needing to me in memory at once and should make the solution much more scalable)

Sort operation will skip elements when comparator returns 0,"The Sort operation uses a TreeSet to sort the results. The TreeSet implementation performs all element comparisons using the comparator, so two elements that are deemed equal by the comparator will be deduplicated.

For example if you use the Sort operation to sort the the following 2 entities based on the value of the count property:

```java
final Entity entity1 = new Entity.Builder()
        .group(TestGroups.ENTITY)
        .vertex(""1"")
        .property(""count"", 1)
        .build();
final Entity entity2 = new Entity.Builder()
        .group(TestGroups.ENTITY)
        .vertex(""2"")
        .property(""count"", 1)
        .build();
```
then you would just get back 1 of the entity as they are deemed to be equal and are deduplicated.

We recommend not using the Sort operation until it has been fixed. In the meantime there are Max and a Min Operations that you could use.

You can easily disable the Sort operation by creating a file (DisableSortOperation.json) containing the following:

```json
{
  ""operations"": [
    {
      ""operation"": ""uk.gov.gchq.gaffer.operation.impl.compare.Sort"",

"Clarify warning message ""serialiser is used for a 'group by' property in an ordered store and it does not preserve the order of bytes""","The `SchemaOptimiser` warns if the serialiser used for a group by property does not preserve the ordering of the property (see line 112). This warning message is confusing:

- It doesn't tell the user how worried they should be - they have to guess at the implications - does it mean that they will get incorrect results (presumably not as if so it should be an error), does it mean that performance will be slower, does it mean that range scans won't work?
- Currently the fact that the serialiser doesn't preserve ordering doesn't cause any issues at all (although see #1134). In future, if we we optimise queries that specify filters on the first N of the group-by properties then the serialiser would need to preserve the ordering.",2017-07-31 12:36:36+00:00,2017-08-14 11:06:39+00:00,2017-08-14 11:06:32+00:00,closed,"[Label(name=""enhancement""), Label(name=""p:normal"")]",1135,https://github.com/gchq/Gaffer/issues/1135,"Milestone(title=""v1.0.0-RC1"", number=43)",False,"NamedUser(login=""p013570"")","[NamedUser(login=""p013570"")]"
Serialisers of group-by properties for ordered stores should be consistent,"If the serialiser for a group-by property isn't consistent (i.e. the same object may potentially be serialised in two different ways) then ingest aggregation in the `AccumuloStore` will not work properly. This is because the group-by properties will not necessarily appear in the correct order (note this is a different, but related, issue to the need for the group-by properties to preserve ordering - here the property may not be comparable so ordering won't be preserved but it's still important for all of the same group-by properties to appear in consecutive rows). Currently the only indication a user will get of that is the warning message ""serialiser is used for a 'group by' property in an ordered store and it does not preserve the order of bytes"" (as the serialiser will presumably be marked as not preserving ordering).

An example of this would be if a user used a `FreqMap` as a group-by property. The serialiser iterates through the `HashMap` writing out the keys and values. The ordering of the keys is not guaranteed so the same map may serialise in 2 different ways.

Options - the first of these is probably best:
- Introduce a method on `Serialiser` to indicate whether the serialisation is consistent. Check that this is true for any property that is used in a group-by in `AccumuloStore` and other similar stores.
- Add Javadoc to `Serialiser` which says that it is assumed that `Serialiser` is consistent (this would require a non-breaking change to `FreqMapSerialiser`).

We should think about how this relates to the current warning message if a serialiser for a group-by property does not preserve ordering (see #1135) - are they independent concepts or should there be a hierarchy: doesn't preserve ordering and may not be consistent; consistent but may not preserve ordering or there might not be an ordering; consistent and preserve ordering?

To a user who specifies a group-by property that isn't serialised consistently then this would appear to be a bug as they might get results in which the ingest aggregation has not happened. Hence this issue is marked as a bug as we should reject such a schema for stores that can't deal with it.",2017-07-31 12:36:06+00:00,2017-08-17 12:07:16+00:00,2017-08-17 12:07:04+00:00,closed,"[Label(name=""bug""), Label(name=""enhancement""), Label(name=""migration-required""), Label(name=""p:high"")]",1134,https://github.com/gchq/Gaffer/issues/1134,"Milestone(title=""v1.0.0-RC1"", number=43)",False,"NamedUser(login=""m607123"")","[NamedUser(login=""m607123"")]"

Gh 1060 multi property aggregation,"A lot of the files that have changed are simply the schema json files.

dataSchema.json -> elements.json
dataTypes.json + storeTypes.json -> types.json

In some cases we used a storeSchema.json file that contained a vertex serialiser. This has been renamed to serialisation.json.

Advanced aggregation and validation has been separated out into aggregation.json and validation.json. 

Renaming these schema files is not a breaking change and does not require users to do the same. I just think that for new users it will be clearer and easier to understand if we split the schema into just the elements and the types.

I have written quite a few unit tests to check the logic for the multi property schema aggregation, but it is a bit tricky so please review that bit carefully.

The change has added an extra section to the Schema but this is optional so hopefully it won't complicate things for novice users of Gaffer. There was a bit of complexity around the change due to not be able to aggregation multiple properties together if they are stored in different places. For example - we will not allow groupBy and non-groupBy properties to be aggregated using the same BinaryOperator. 

See #1060 for a discussion around this feature and for the update Schema wiki page content.

Before we merge this in we should check that we are all happy with the extra ""aggregator"" section in the schema and that it doesn't complicate things for users.",2017-07-21 16:16:10+00:00,2017-07-26 12:31:42+00:00,2017-07-26 12:31:40+00:00,closed,[],1087,https://github.com/gchq/Gaffer/pull/1087,,False,,[]

Add migration steps to the Accumulo Store README,"Currently we don't provide any documentation on how update a Schema in Accumulo. We need to add a section into the Accumulo Store README containing the following information (copied from issue #1058):


You can do the following:
- add new groups
- add new non-groupBy properties (including visibility and timestamp), but they must go after the other properties
- rename properties
- change aggregators
- change validators
- change descriptions

You cannot do the following:
- rename groups
- remove any properties (groupBy, non-groupBy, visibility or timestamp)
- add new groupBy properties
- reorder any of the properties. In the Accumulo store we don't use any property names, we just rely on the order the properties are defined in the schema.
- change the way properties or vertices are serialised - i.e don't change the serialisers.
- change which properties are groupBy

Please note, that the validation functions in the schema can be a bit dangerous. If an element is found to be invalid then the element will be permanently deleted from the table. So, be very careful when making changes to your schema that you don't accidentally make all your existing elements invalid as you will quickly realise all your data has been deleted. For example, if you add a new property 'prop1' and set the validateFunctions to be a single Exists predicate. Then when that Exists predicate is applied to all of your existing elements, those old elements will fail validation and be removed.


Once you have your updated schema, all you need to do is update the Accumulo table's iterators with the new schema's.
And We have a utility for this 
https://github.com/gchq/Gaffer/blob/master/store-implementation/accumulo-store/src/main/java/uk/gov/gchq/gaffer/accumulostore/utils/AddUpdateTableIterator.java

You need to provide a comma separated list of schema file paths,  a store Properties file path and the argument: update.

You can do this programatically through the class by calling main method with the above arguments.
Admittedly It's not the most publicly facing API at the moment, we've had some other thoughts around storing schema's in some kind of central location - which could also then make it much simpler to update them on the stores. But we've not really looked at this too much.



If you have existing data, then before doing any form of upgrade or change to your table I would strongly recommend using the accumulo shell to clone the table so you have a backup so you can easily restore to that version if things go wrong. Even if you have an error like the one above where all your data is deleted in your table you will still be able to quickly revert back to your backup. Cloning a table in Accumulo is very simple and fast (it doesn't actually copy the data). If you have a table called 'table1', you can do something like the following in the Accumulo shell
```bash
> offline -t table1
> clone table table1 table1-backup
> offline -t table1-backup

# Do your upgrades
#   - deploy new gaffer jars to accumulo
#   - run the AddUpdateTableIterator class to update table1

> online -t table1

# Check table1 is still healthy:
#   - run a query and check the iterators are successfully aggregating and filtering elements correctly.

> droptable -t table1-backup

Allow multiple properties to be aggregated using a single aggregate function,"We need to update the SchemaElementDefinition class to allow a ElementAggregator to be provided. Then getFullAggregator, getIngestAggregator and getQueryAggregator methods will need to be updated to use combine the Type aggregators and the schema element definition aggregator.

We need to restrict which properties can be aggregated at the same time. For example, you should not be allow to aggregate a groupBy property and a non-groupBy property in the same Binary Operator. When ingest aggregation is applied, only the non-groupBy properties are aggregated so we need Binary Operators that only apply to non-groupBy properties. The different types of properties are: groupBy, non-groupBy, visibility, timestamp. 


As schemas can be split up into different files we probably should have another think about the structure of these files and in which file the new ElementAggregator functions go. The aggregation logic is Store specific so it shouldn't be mixed up with the other data schema parts. 

We could change the schema files (dataSchema, dataTypes, storeTypes) to be something like:

- schema
- types
- serialisation   (store specific)
- validation    (overrides type validation and allows you to validate multiple properties at once)

gh-659 - updated tests to use the edge builder,I've just changed all tests to use the Edge.Builder instead of the Edge constructor.

Aggregation on multiple properties and schema changes,"Got a couple issues that I've been spending some time with workarounds and want to make sure I'm not missing anything.  Am working with accumulo store, in case that is relevant.  If there is documentation somewhere that I'm missing that addresses these feel free to just point me to it, as I could easily have missed it.  Thanks!

1. I find myself sometimes wanting to aggregate a property based on other properties (not just the one I'm aggregating on), specifically based on the timestamp (ie. often something simple like grabbing the latest).  From a looking at the code I'm not sure a reason it couldn't be supported (at least in the accumulo case) but it didn't seem like it is.  Writing a schema i've found myself just wrapping the timestamp in the property so it's not that big of a deal, but adds some duplication and can prevent me from using something simple like a primitive type.

2.   For my use-case I need to be flexible in allowing the creation of new types of elements.  Is there any documentation on migrating to a schema with an added element group?  Will simply providing a new schema at runtime with the new element group be an issue, or does it require an export/import to a new accumulo data store?  I can add the new type into a groupBy field instead of making it a element group, but seems a bit wrong to do so.

* I've added a additional endpoint (/latest) which redirects to the latest version of the API - is this useful?
* At the moment, only one version of the API can be served up through Swagger - this needs to be configured by the application. Are there use cases where we would want to allow access to all versions of the API via Swagger?

Add a graphId to uniquely identify an instance of a Gaffer graph,"A large number of files have changed, but the change in the majority of files is just to simply added a graphId whenever a Graph is instantiated or a Store is initialised.

This is needed for issue gh-954. The rest of the changes for that issue will come later. The final part of that issue is to add the Graph Library. The Graph Library needs this graphId to uniquely identify a schema and store properties.

Gh 406 accumulo itrs,"Sorry about the large number of files changed.

The main changes are:
- ValidatorFilter, ElementPreAggregationFilter and ElementPostAggregationFilter accumulo iterators are only applied if they are actually required. I.e there are filters defined in the schema/view.
- ValidatorFilter, ElementPreAggregationFilter and ElementPostAggregationFilter iterators now lazily deserialise the different accumulo columns. So if you only filter on groupBy properties then we don't need to deserialise all the properties in the Value, just the ones in the column qualifier.
- The accumulo handler for GetAdjacentIds now only deserialisers the rowId and extracts the destination. Unless the user provides post transform filters.
- Tidied up some other classes.

The Raw Serialisers do not preserve object ordering,"The Raw Serialisers (RawLongSerialiser, RawDateSerialiser, etc.) do not always preserve object ordering.

For example if you serialise the following longs you, they should be serialised into bytes that maintains the same ordering.

1. 1496709602656   ->  [96, 29, -40, 122, 92, 1, 0, 0]
2. 1496710980959   ->  [95, 37, -19, 122, 92, 1, 0, 0]
3. 1496710980960   ->  [96, 37, -19, 122, 92, 1, 0, 0]
4. 1496710980961   ->  [97, 37, -19, 122, 92, 1, 0, 0]

So the values of the serialised bytes ends up reordering the values into:

2. 1496710980959   ->  [95, 37, -19, 122, 92, 1, 0, 0]
1. 1496709602656   ->  [96, 29, -40, 122, 92, 1, 0, 0]
3. 1496710980960   ->  [96, 37, -19, 122, 92, 1, 0, 0]
4. 1496710980961   ->  [97, 37, -19, 122, 92, 1, 0, 0]


The ordering of the serialisers is important when using an ordered database/store, like Accumulo or HBase. If using either of these Gaffer Stores, you should use an serialiser that preserves object ordering for your vertices. If your vertices are serialised on an ordered fashion then you are able to do [range scans](https://github.com/gchq/Gaffer/wiki/Accumulo-specific-operation-examples#getelementsinranges-example).

It is advised that Properties included in the groupBy should also be serialised with an ordered serialiser to help maintain true ordering of the Accumulo/HBase row keys. However, this is not essential, but you will not be able to carry out range scans over other columns in the row key (column qualifier/visibility).

To fix this bug, we should deprecate all of the Raw Serialisers and write new serialisers based on:
https://github.com/apache/accumulo/blob/f81a8ec7410e789d11941351d5899b8894c6a322/core/src/main/java/org/apache/accumulo/core/client/lexicoder/ULongLexicoder.java.

We will need to update the Serialisation Factories, removing the deprecated serialisers and adding the new ones. This will break the serialisation of all the serialised data that has been serialised with the Raw Serialisers and have not explicitly defined them in their schema. This would occur due to new serialisation factory selecting the new serialiser, which will not be compatible with the existing serialised bytes. We must inform users that if they have an existing table in accumulo or hbase that they need to manually define the Raw Serialisers they are using in their schema.

Existing Gaffer Accumulo tables pre 0.7.4 cannot be migrated to 0.7.4,"The AddUpdateTableIterator utility is used to migrate an accumulo table from one version to the next.

The Accumulo aggregator iterator config was changed in 0.7.4 and this means the utility will always fail to run.

As a work around you will need to open the accumulo shell and manually update the Aggregator iterator config before running the AddUpdateTableIterator utility:

```bash

Create a federated Gaffer Store,"This should be done after gh-954.

We have a [federated rest api](https://github.com/gchq/gaffer-tools/tree/master/federated-rest) in gaffer-tools, but it would also be useful to have a federated gaffer store.

This store would hold a list of Graphs. 
Each operation would be executed on each graph and the results would be merged together.

All operations (including the core operations like Min and Max) would need a new Operation Handler that delegates the query to all of the configured Graphs and merges the result. Perhaps create a abstract handler - FederatedOperationHandler that does all the delegation then the handlers would just have to deal with taking a List of results and merging them together. 

e.g
```java
public abstract class FederatedOperationHandler<OP extends Output<O>, O> implements OutputOperationHandler<OP, O> {
    @Override
    public O doOperation(final OP operation, final Context context, final Store store) throws OperationException {
        final List<Graph> graphs = store.getGraphs();
        final List<O> results = new ArrayList<O>(graphs.size());
        for (final Graph graph : graphs) {
            results.add(graph.execute(operation, context.getUser()));
        }

        return mergeResults(results, operation, context, store);
    }

    protected abstract O mergeResults(final List<O> results, final OP operation, final Context context, final Store store);
}



public class MaxHandler extends FederatedOperationHandler<Max, Element> {
    @Override
    protected Element mergeResults(final List<Element> results, final Max operation, final Context context, final Store store) {
        return Collections.max(results, operation.getCombinedComparator());
    }
}

public class GetElementsHandler extends FederatedOperationHandler<GetElements, CloseableIterable<? extends Element>> {
    @Override
    protected CloseableIterable<? extends Element> mergeResults(final List<CloseableIterable<? extends Element>> results, final GetElements operation, final Context context, final Store store) {
        // Concatenate all the results into 1 iterable
        return new ChainedIterable<>(results);
    }
}

```

Delegate Graphs will need to be added, fetched and removed from the FederatedStore. We will need some need operations to do that.

Create a Graph Library to store and retrieve Schemas and StoreProperties,"Currently every time you construct a Graph instance you need to provide the original Schema and store properties. If the Graph instance is constructed with a different Schema then it will conflict with the original Schema and cause problems.

The Schema and Store Properties should be persisted by the Graph using a GraphLibrary so it doesn't have to be provided every time a user constructs a new Graph instance.

To implement this change we will need to introduce a few new IDs. A Schema ID, a Store Properties ID and a Graph ID. The Graph ID should be used to uniquely define a graph - it will be associated with a Schema ID and a Store Properties ID. 

We should write a GraphLibrary interface that has methods for persisting and retrieving schemas and store properties.

Then we can update the Graph.Builder class to allow Graphs to be built using just a Graph ID (and GraphLibrary), in which the Schema and Store Properties can be retrieved from the GraphLibrary.

Alternatively a user could create a new Graph with a new Graph ID, new Schema, but refer to existing Store Properties using a Store Properties ID.

In the case of accumulo and hbase, we should remove the 'accumulo.table' and 'hbase.table' properties and use the graphId instead. 

Note the Schema persisted should be the full (non-compact) schema including all the description fields.

<dependency>
    <groupId>uk.gov.gchq.gaffer.core</groupId>
    <artifactId>graph</artifactId>
    <version>[gaffer.version]</version>

<dependency>
    <groupId>uk.gov.gchq.gaffer</groupId>
    <artifactId>accumulo-store</artifactId>
    <version>[gaffer.version]</version>
</dependency>

When I put it in my POM (with version 0.7.3) and started building I got this error:
""The POM for uk.gov.gchq.gaffer.core:graph:jar:0.7.3 is missing, no dependency information available""

Looking around at the project, I dropped the "".core"" in the first dependency group, changing it to: ""uk.gov.gchq.gaffer"", rebuilt and it completed build and has been working (so far).  

So, I think this is just a small documentation update...

Create an Apache Parquet backed store,"It would be useful to have a store that scales well and is suitable for carrying out full table scans.
Apache Parquet seems to be a good candidate as Spark has been optimised for high performance reads of Parquet data. By sorting the data before writing, Parquet can be optimised for random access as well as full scans.

- Support for ingest aggregation
- Support for seeded queries with pre-aggregation filters that naturally fit to Parquet filters
- Store the data in an optimised way to make best use of the Parquet file format
- Expose the data as a Spark Dataframe

The Initial version will not be suitable for:
- Streaming data into
- Query time transformations
- Query time aggregation
- Fine grain security

Typical use cases could include:
- For applying a Page Rank algorithm against yesterday's data

Improve GetAdjacentIds Accumulo and HBase handlers,"To get an adjacent vertex, the Accumulo and HBase operation handlers fetch the entire Edge object and then simply extracts the destination vertex. It would be more efficient to just fetch the destination vertex.

The handler also relies on a magic operation option 'return_matched_id_as_edge_source' which returns edges with the source and destination flipped so the source is the vertex that was matched against a seed. This option can cause confusion as directed edges may be returned the wrong way around. We should investigate if there is a clearer way of doing this. Perhaps returned a different type of edge, e.g a BackwardsEdge or changing the directed field to be an Enum - FORWARDS, BACKWARDS, FORWARDS_DIR, BACKWARDS_DIR.",2017-05-17 20:44:21+00:00,2017-07-13 19:18:39+00:00,2017-07-05 09:23:08+00:00,closed,"[Label(name=""enhancement""), Label(name=""p:high"")]",906,https://github.com/gchq/Gaffer/issues/906,"Milestone(title=""v0.7.6"", number=40)",False,"NamedUser(login=""p013570"")","[NamedUser(login=""p013570""), NamedUser(login=""t616178"")]"

Update map store to allow complex Map implementations such as Hazelcast,"Currently the map store allows you to specify the class of the Map implementation to use, this is a really useful feature as there are a lot of different Map implementations and this gives the user a lot of flexibility. However, for some more advanced Maps, such as Hazelcast's implementation, it might be necessary to provide a MapFactory class or something similar to add extra logic to control how we fetch/create maps. For some map implementations we may also need to provide a configuration file.

The MapFactory interface could be something like:

```java
public interface MapFactory {
    void initialise(final MapStoreProperties properties);

    <K, V> Map<K, V> newMap(final String mapName);

    default <K, V> Map<K, V> newMap() {
        return newMap(""default"");
    }
}
```

The default simple implementation of this could just be:
```java
public class SimpleMapFactory implements MapFactory {
    private Class<? extends Map> mapClass;

    @Override
    public void initialise(final MapStoreProperties properties) {
        try {
            mapClass = Class.forName(properties.getMapClass()).asSubclass(Map.class);
        } catch (ClassNotFoundException e) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException(""Map Class is invalid: "" + properties.getMapClass(), e);
        }
    }

    @Override
    public <K, V> Map<K, V> newMap(final String mapName) {
        try {
            return mapClass.newInstance();
        } catch (InstantiationException | IllegalAccessException e) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException(""Unable to create new map instance of type: "" + mapClass.getName());
        }
    }
}
```

We may also need to make some other changes to the MapImpl to work with persistent maps implementations. 

For the Hazelcast example, it is more efficient in Hazelcast to call a special 'set' method instead of 'put'. We should consider the possibility of allowing Map implementations to override some of this logic too to improve the performance.

We should then add a new integration test suite for the MapStore, that runs the integrations tests over a different map implementation. This is just a case of duplicating the MapStoreITs class and providing a different store.properties file.

Or and And predicates only accept a single property,"Since updating to use the Koryphe functions library in version 0.7.0 the Or and And Predicates now only work with a single property.

 For example you can select a property (e.g count) and pass that same property value to multiple predicates:

```java
new View.Builder()
        .edge(""RedEdge"", new ViewElementDefinition.Builder()
                .preAggregationFilter(new ElementFilter.Builder()

                .build())
        .build()
```

Prior to 0.7.0 you could select multiple properties then within the Or function you could do select which properties to pass to which functions, it was complicated to write but it used to work like this:
```java
new View.Builder()
        .edge(""RedEdge"", new ViewElementDefinition.Builder()

Allow named operations to be run with custom parameters,"Currently when you run a NamedOperation you can set a custom view. This is applied to all operations in the named operation chain that don't have a predefined view. This doesn't work very well and does provide enough flexibility for users to configure parts of the named operation such as filtering values.

We should remove the ability provide a view in the NamedOperation class - i.e remove ""implements OperationView"".

Instead we need to add allow users to do something like:

```java
new NamedOperation.Builder()
    .name(""1-hop"")
    .input(new EntitySeed(""vertex1""))
    .parameter(""maxCount"", 10)
    .parameter(""minStartDate"", ""01/01/2017"")
    .build();
```

The ""1-hop"" named operation could have an operation defined similar to:
```
new GetElements.Builder()
                .view(""redEdge"", new ViewElementDefinition.Builder()
                        .preAggregationFilter(new ElementFilter.Builder()
                                .select(""count"")
                                .execute(new IsLessThan(${maxCount}))
                                .select(""startDate"")
                                .execute(new IsMoreThan(${minStartDate}))
                                .build())
                        .build()
                .build();
```

So named operations need to have custom parameters that will be resolved when it is executed. The parameters should also be able to have default values and a description.",2017-05-04 12:17:51+00:00,2017-06-28 11:45:39+00:00,2017-06-23 10:18:33+00:00,closed,"[Label(name=""enhancement""), Label(name=""p:high"")]",868,https://github.com/gchq/Gaffer/issues/868,"Milestone(title=""v0.7.5"", number=39)",False,"NamedUser(login=""p013570"")","[NamedUser(login=""p013570"")]"

Create operations for standard functions like max,"There is an operation called `Count` that simply counts the number of items in a provided iterable. This was introduced because the `MapStore` can optimise an operation chain that retrieves all elements (with the standard `View`) and then counts the number of them, into a single operation that is implemented very efficiently (see issue #802).

We should provide other operations like max, min and sum that can be used on properties on elements returned from queries. For example a query may return an iterable of elements, and the user may want to return only the element with the largest value of a ""count"" long property.

Users of the Java API may find it easiest to perform these operations by converting the iterable of results into a Java Stream, and then call standard Java functions. However, these cannot be used over the REST API. The advantage of wrapping standard functions in operations is that they can then be put into operation chains and used via REST.",2017-04-25 09:11:01+00:00,2017-05-17 15:01:42+00:00,2017-05-17 15:01:35+00:00,closed,"[Label(name=""enhancement""), Label(name=""p:normal"")]",849,https://github.com/gchq/Gaffer/issues/849,"Milestone(title=""v0.7.1"", number=36)",False,"NamedUser(login=""t616178"")","[NamedUser(login=""t616178"")]"

We should investigate setting a configuration property on a table when Gaffer creates it. Whenever a new store is created against that table, then the property could be checked, and if it is not present then the creation of the store should fail (if there are scenarios where experienced users may need to manually create a table and add iterators, then there could be an option on the store properties to ignore this warning, and carry on, but the default should be to fail).",2017-04-25 08:54:06+00:00,2017-04-26 11:30:02+00:00,2017-04-26 11:29:53+00:00,closed,"[Label(name=""invalid"")]",848,https://github.com/gchq/Gaffer/issues/848,,False,,[]

An example should also be provided of the affects of these filters for undirected edges. For example, if undirected edge B-A is inserted into a graph, and B is queried for, with a filter saying that the destination should be A or match A* then no results will be returned, because B is the destination (as they are automatically reordered so that A is the source). When executing such queries on undirected edges, the user should specify that either the source or the destination is A (it will be interesting to see how easy this is to specify in the current select, execute model of filters).",2017-04-23 13:59:11+00:00,2017-07-07 11:15:53+00:00,2017-07-07 11:15:48+00:00,closed,"[Label(name=""enhancement""), Label(name=""p:normal"")]",838,https://github.com/gchq/Gaffer/issues/838,"Milestone(title=""v0.7.6"", number=40)",False,"NamedUser(login=""p013570"")","[NamedUser(login=""p013570"")]"
Investigate improving Kryo serialisation for classes from DataSketches,"It should be possible to register the classes from the DataSketches library that we have serialisers for in the Kryo Registrator.

Gh 659 consistent edge creation,"I have made the Edge class immutable (removed default constructors and setters). I've also done the same to the Entity class to have some consistency between the two Element implementations.

The classes are not *fully* immutable currently. In order to swap the source and destination in the Edge class I have kept the fields non-final. I have also left the ""putIdentifier"" methods on both classes. This is currently used only when creating ElementTuple objects, but it does allow a way of modifying the fields on an Element. If this is undesirable, then I'd suggest opening two new issues:

* Move vertex swapping in the Edge class to Builder method. This will have the side effect of forcing the source and destination to be specified when invoking the build() method. Currently it's possible to create an empty Edge (i.e new Edge.Builder().build()), which has null for both source and destination.
* Make ElementTuple immutable.

Apologies for the number of changes - this was always going to be a problem when changing the Edge and Entity classes.",2017-04-21 10:06:20+00:00,2017-04-26 11:18:43+00:00,2017-04-26 11:18:43+00:00,closed,[],835,https://github.com/gchq/Gaffer/pull/835,,False,,[]
Collaboration with DataSketches.github.io,"@p013570 

I can see that your Gaffer team is using a number of sketches from our library.  Excellent.  We also get a number of queries about use of sketches in graph databases.  We can certainly point to Gaffer, but I think a closer collaboration would be beneficial.  We have a number of new sketches in development, for example the VarOpt sketch for superior accuracy for weighted ""reservoir"" sampling.  I would like to get some feedback on your interest in new sketch types as well as questions or comments on usability or documentation of our library.  If you are interested, you can start a discussion on https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sketches-user, or add an issue to https://github.com/DataSketches/sketches-core/issues.  Thanks.

Improve the wiki,"It would be better for pages like the Accumulo store guide to live as a README.md file alongside the accumulo store implementation. Then when releases are done we can copy the README.md file onto the wiki. This way it would stay more up to date and be versioned with Gaffer releases.

We should add a message similar to:

""This page been copied from [README](https://github.com/gchq/Gaffer/blob/master/store-implementation/accumulo-store/README.md). To make changes please update the README.md.""


There are several different types of users of Gaffer so we should split up the Getting Started page to target the different users:
- Quick Start
- Configuring Gaffer - how to write custom functions, operations, schema, etc.
- Querying Gaffer - how to execute operations

The getting started guide would be easier to follow if each step built on the previous. To do this, I suggest using the Road Traffic example in Gaffer Tools as a basis and building up to the fully working Road Traffic example.

Create in-memory store backed by a Java Map,"It would be useful to have an in-memory store. The first version of this will use a standard Java HashMap. It will not scale to large volumes, but it will be very high performance for queries. It should be optimised to support aggregation efficiently.

- A simple in-memory cache of `Element`s that have been retrieved from a large store.
- The creation of examples of how operations work, how views work, etc, without the need to use the `AccumuloStore`.
- The aggregation of data within a streaming process, i.e. ingest data into an in-memory map aggregating properties if the same element is seen multiple times followed by periodic export of the whole graph into a larger (e.g. Accumulo-based) store.

Users may want to use a different cache implementation depending on their requirements (i.e. JCS, Hazelcast, Ehcache etc). Therefore the gaffer cache service hides the implementation behind an interface and loads the exact service at runtime using a system variable. This provides a clean interface for all components to use, whilst providing options in terms of specific implementation.

"Change directed field in EdgeSeed to directed, undirected or either","In `EdgeSeed` you can specify whether the `Edge` you are looking for is directed or undirected, but you can't say you are looking for any edges between A and B irrespective of whether they're directed or not. The directed field should be changed so that it's either DIRECTED, UNDIRECTED or EITHER.

One of the key design criteria in version 1 of Gaffer was to be able to find all edges between A and B in a single range. The `ClassicKeyPackage` in the Accumulo store stores data in a way that allows a single range to be constructed, but the user is forced to specify multiple `EdgeSeed`s to get all edges between A and B. As part of this change the `ClassicKeyPackage` should be able to construct one range when the EITHER option is selected.",2017-03-14 09:05:17+00:00,2017-06-13 13:47:22+00:00,2017-05-31 12:01:06+00:00,closed,"[Label(name=""enhancement""), Label(name=""migration-required""), Label(name=""p:normal"")]",752,https://github.com/gchq/Gaffer/issues/752,"Milestone(title=""v0.7.4"", number=38)",False,"NamedUser(login=""p013570"")","[NamedUser(login=""p013570"")]"

The switch to deserialising schemas using builders might be triggering this bug: https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/761. Although the Gaffer iterators jar includes a later version of jackson that is unaffected by this issue, the CDH5 distribution of Hadoop includes jackson-core-2.2.3.jar and jackson-databind-2.2.3.jar in the mapreduce lib directory, which appears earlier on Accumulo's classpath so gets used instead.

Create an exporter to cache result objects,"This follows on from gh-720.

When an operation chain is run asynchronously any output results are just lost. So this issue is to implement an exporter that can be used in an operation chain to export any results (elements, seeds, any json serialisable objects) to cache. These results could then be looked up using the async job id. The cache would need to provide visibility filtering, age off and be capable of holding a large number of results. The type of cache should be configurable.

This is similar to gh-284 but 284 only considers exporting Gaffer Elements. This issue requires any type of result object to be cached.",2017-02-22 14:33:41+00:00,2017-03-08 15:55:09+00:00,2017-03-07 16:51:01+00:00,closed,"[Label(name=""enhancement""), Label(name=""p:high"")]",721,https://github.com/gchq/Gaffer/issues/721,"Milestone(title=""v0.6.2"", number=29)",False,"NamedUser(login=""p013570"")","[NamedUser(login=""p013570"")]"
Create Job Tracker and allow operation chains to be executed asynchronously,"### High level design

Create a separate method in the Graph class called ""executeJob"". This method would generate a 'jobId' (a random id based on the user id, timestamp and a random value) and this value would immediately be returned to the user. Create a new thread and delegate the operation chain to the execute method.

Asynchronous jobs will need to be tracked - so the jobId should be stored along with a job status in a 'Job Tracker' this could be backed various different caches.

An operation should be created to get the details of a job for a given job id.",2017-02-22 12:11:11+00:00,2017-03-08 15:55:43+00:00,2017-03-08 13:04:39+00:00,closed,"[Label(name=""enhancement""), Label(name=""p:high"")]",720,https://github.com/gchq/Gaffer/issues/720,"Milestone(title=""v0.6.2"", number=29)",False,"NamedUser(login=""p013570"")","[NamedUser(login=""p013570"")]"

The code should be replaced by a while loop that pulls from the source iterable until either a valid element is found (and so true is returned) or the source has no more items (and so false is returned).

An easy way to create this bug is to run:

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Set<Element> x = new HashSet<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < 10000; i++) {
            x.add(new Entity(""G"", """" + i));
        }
        ValidatedElements ve = new ValidatedElements(x, new View.Builder().build(), true);
        Iterator<Element> it = ve.iterator();
        while (it.hasNext()) {
            it.next();
        }
    }

Consistent src and dest in undirected edges,"An undirected edge A-B is identical to the undirected edge B-A, and the `equals()` method on `Edge` will return true in this case. However when `toString()` is called the string representation of the edge will be different. The JSON version of the edge will also be different. In older versions of Gaffer, undirected edges were always created in a consistent manner, with the source being lexicographically before the destination. As the source and destination are now just objects, there may be no natural ordering, but `toString()` can be used instead.

When the edge is created the logic would be:

    if source and destination are both instances of comparable:
         if destination < source
              swap destination and source
    else
          if destination.toString() < source.toString()

HyperLogLogPlusAggregator only works with one size of sketch,"The `HyperLogLogPlusAggregator` only works with sketches where `p = 5` and `sp = 5`.

This behaviour can be seen by changing the two instances of `new HyperLogLogPlus(5, 5)` in the `setup` method of `HyperLogLogPlusAggregatorTest` to `new HyperLogLogPlus(6, 6)`. The test then fails.

The problem is caused by the following line in `HyperLogLogPlusAggregator`:

    if (null == sketch) {
        sketch = new HyperLogLogPlus(5, 5);
    }

As the `sketch` variable is always null after the aggregator is initialised, this means that the first sketch to be aggregated is merged into the `HyperLogLogPlus` with parameters 5 and 5. If the sketch to be merged in has different parameters then it fails with a `java.lang.RuntimeException: An Exception occurred when trying to aggregate the HyperLogLogPlus objects`.

To fix this, when the first sketch is merged in, the sketch variable should be set to a clone of the first sketch.",2017-01-05 16:44:03+00:00,2017-01-19 15:19:06+00:00,2017-01-11 14:10:53+00:00,closed,"[Label(name=""bug""), Label(name=""p:high"")]",630,https://github.com/gchq/Gaffer/issues/630,"Milestone(title=""v0.6.0"", number=22)",False,"NamedUser(login=""p013570"")","[NamedUser(login=""p013570"")]"
Serialisation class Javadoc issues,"There are some issues with the Javadoc in the `Serialisation` class:

- The second line of the Javadoc at the top of the class is irrelevant - ""As a minimum, any Serialisation mechanism must be able to serialise and deserialise any given Property"" - there is no ""Property"" here - just a T. The first line is also confusing. It should be rewritten to say:
""A class that implements this interface is responsible for serialising an object of class T to a byte array, and for deserialising it back again. It must also be able to deal with serialising null values.""
- The comment on the `deserialise` method should be rewritten to say ""Deserialise an array of bytes to the original object.""
- The comment on the `isByteOrderPreserved` method is confusing - it's not about whether the byte order is preserved - it's whether the serialised form preserves the ordering of the objects. The method should really be renamed to `preservesObjectOrder`. The Javadoc should also note what should be returned if this method makes no sense, e.g. if T is not `Comparable`. The Javadoc should say: ""This method indicates whether the serialisation process preserves the ordering of the T, i.e. if x and y are objects of class T, and x is less than y, then this method should return true if the serialised form of x is guaranteed to be less than the serialised form of y (using the standard ordering of byte arrays). If T is not `Comparable` then this test makes no sense and false should be returned.""

Add helper methods for adding Cardinality Entities,"It is good practise to add Cardinality entities onto every vertex in a Gaffer graph. This allows you to quickly see how connected each vertex is.

Doing this requires a new Entity in a schema:
```json
""entities"": {
    ""Cardinality"": {
       ""vertex"": ""anyObject"",
       ""properties"": {
           ""edgeGroup"": ""string"",
           ""cardinality"": ""hyperLogLogPlus"",
            [""other optional properties""]
        }
    }
},
""types"" {
    ""hyperLogLogPlus"": {
        ""class"": ""com.clearspring.analytics.stream.cardinality.HyperLogLogPlus"",
        ""aggregateFunction"": ""gaffer.function.simple.aggregate.HyperLogLogPlusAggregator"",
        ""serialiserClass"": ""gaffer.serialisation.simple.HyperLogLogPlusSerialiser"" 
    }
}
```

Then whenever an Edge is added to Gaffer, 2 Entities should also be added, one at the source vertex and one at the destination vertex. Aggregation will then merge the entities together. These entities could be added as part of a generator, however that would mean any edges that are added not via a generator would not get the relevant cardinalities. Alternatively we could create an AbstractAddElementHandler that wrapped the Iterable<Elements> in a TransformOneToManyIterable and for each edge it lazily adds 2 cardinality entities.

For example in the AbstractAddElementsHandler we could have something like this (however it would mean calling instanceof, Collections.singleton and Arrays.asList a lot - there must be a more efficient way of doing it):

```java
return new TransformOneToManyIterable<Element, Element>(elements) {
    @Override
    protected Iterable<Element> transform(final Element element) {
        if(element instanceof Entity) {
            return Collections.singleton(element);
        }
        final Edge edge = (Edge) element;
        return Arrays.asList(
                edge,
                createCardinaltity(edge.getSource(), edge), 
                createCardinaltity(edge.getDestination(), edge)
        );
    }
};


private Entity createCardinaltity(final Object vertex, final Edge edge) {
        final Entity entity = new Entity(""Cardinality"", vertex);
        entity.putProperty(""edgeGroup"", edge.getGroup());

        // create a hyperLogLogPlus instance using the provided edge.
        entity.putProperty(""cardinality"", hyperLogLogPlus);

        // add any optional required properties

        return entity;
    }
```",2016-11-10 09:21:26+00:00,2017-11-22 14:23:38+00:00,2017-11-22 14:23:34+00:00,closed,"[Label(name=""enhancement""), Label(name=""p:normal"")]",539,https://github.com/gchq/Gaffer/issues/539,,False,,[]

A view should contain the operation seeds,"In the future, you will be able to query Gaffer using vertex, group or property seed. The View is designed to override a Schema. So it follows that a View could override the source vertex of and edge group with some seeds. Or, a View could override a property with some seeds.

For example:

Using this schema (based on users viewing/watching films):
```json
{
  ""edges"": {
    ""viewing"": {
      ""source"": ""userId"",
      ""destination"": ""filmId"",
      ""directed"": ""true"",
      ""properties"": {
        ""startTime"": ""timestamp"",
        ""count"": ""count""
      }
    }
  }
}
```

A view with some source vertex seeds may look like this:
```json
{
  ""edges"": {
    ""viewing"": {
      ""source"": [""user01"", ""user02""]
    }
  }
}
```

Or a view with that limits edges to only directed edges. This would require a magic group called ""ALL"" :
```json
{
  ""edges"": {
    ""ALL"":  {
      ""directed"": true
    }
  }
}
```

Or a view with a property seed may look like this:
```json
{
  ""edges"": {
      ""properties"": {
        ""count"": [5]
      }
    }
  }
}
```


This would have an effect on operation chains. Needs further designing.",2016-11-09 13:36:34+00:00,2017-02-01 15:29:50+00:00,2016-12-14 14:21:00+00:00,closed,"[Label(name=""wontfix"")]",536,https://github.com/gchq/Gaffer/issues/536,,False,,[]
Refactor Add and Get element operations,"Currently we have a couple versions of AddElements - AddElements and AddElementsFromHdfs.

Similar we have a few GetElements - e.g GetElements, GetJavaRDDOfAllElements, GetRDDOfElements, GetDataFrameOfElements.
It would be neater to have a GetElements operation that takes a Destination object, describing the format of the result.

This is a similar pattern to the Export operation with an Exporter. The Export operation could be deleted and these Exporters could be changed to work with GetElements and a Destination.",2016-11-09 13:27:41+00:00,2017-06-27 13:04:11+00:00,2017-06-22 12:22:36+00:00,closed,"[Label(name=""wontfix"")]",535,https://github.com/gchq/Gaffer/issues/535,,False,,[]

Introduce concept of tag for groups,"The group of an element defines the properties that will be present on it. There are often natural groupings of groups, i.e. groups that are related in some way, e.g. red edges and red entities where the red entities contain properties that summarise the red edges. If groups could be tagged in the schema, and a tag used to create a view, then it would give an easy way to generate graphs containing groups that belong together.

An example would be having groups called red_edge_group, blue_edge_group, red_entity_group, big_edge_group, etc. Tags could be applied to the groups, e.g. red, colour, size. A view could be created from the red tag that would return just the red_edge_group and red_entity_group. A view from the colour tag would return red_edge_group, blue_edge_group, red_entity_group.

This is related to #519 but different as that is referring to filtering based on properties. This proposal does not involve adding a tag property to every element. It simply tags groups in the schema, so that domain knowledge of which groups belong together can be encoded in the schema and later used to easily produce views that contain elements that make sense.

This makes it easier to have rich graphs with lots of different types of data, but easily generate subgraphs with groups that together form a coherent view on the data. The ability to create your own view that produces exactly what you want would still exist.",2016-11-04 10:33:47+00:00,2017-11-23 14:09:51+00:00,2017-11-23 14:09:38+00:00,closed,"[Label(name=""wontfix"")]",530,https://github.com/gchq/Gaffer/issues/530,,False,,[]

Allow global filters to be applied to an Operation View,"Currently if a schema contains multiple groups with a common property such as 'tag' or 'timestamp'. Then if I wanted to fetch all elements from Gaffer that have a 'tag' equal to some value (e.g 'red') then I would have to do the following:

```json
{
  ""view"" : {
    ""edges"" : {
      ""edgeGroup1"" : {
        ""preAggregationFilterFunctions"" : [ {
          ""function"" : {
            ""class"" : ""gaffer.function.simple.filter.IsEqual"",
            ""value"" : ""red""
          },
          ""selection"" : [""tag""]
        } ]
      },
      ""edgeGroup2"" : {
        ""preAggregationFilterFunctions"" : [ {
          ""function"" : {
            ""class"" : ""gaffer.function.simple.filter.IsEqual"",
            ""value"" : ""red""

      },

        ""preAggregationFilterFunctions"" : [ {
          ""function"" : {
            ""class"" : ""gaffer.function.simple.filter.IsEqual"",
            ""value"" : ""red""
          },
          ""selection"" : [""tag""]
        } ]
      }
    },
    ""entities"" : {
      ""entityGroup1"" : {
        ""preAggregationFilterFunctions"" : [ {
          ""function"" : {
            ""class"" : ""gaffer.function.simple.filter.IsEqual"",
            ""value"" : ""red""
          },
          ""selection"" : [""tag""]
        } ]
      },

        ""preAggregationFilterFunctions"" : [ {
          ""function"" : {

          },
          ""selection"" : [""tag""]
        } ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

As you can see there is a huge amount of duplication and it requires the users to list all groups that contain that tag property. This would be simplified by specifying a global filter. We should allow multiple different global filters to provided for all or a specified set of element groups. e.g:

```json
{
  ""view"": {
    ""globalElements"": [
      {
        ""preAggregationFilterFunctions"": [
          {
            ""function"": {
              ""class"": ""gaffer.function.simple.filter.IsEqual"",
              ""value"": ""red""
            },
            ""selection"": [""tag""]
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
Behind the scenes Gaffer could take this filter and add it to all groups that contain the 'tag' property.


a more complex example:

```json
{
  ""view"": {
    ""entities"": {
      ""BasicEntity3"": {
        ""groupBy"": [""dateProperty""],
        ""preAggregationFilterFunctions"": [
          {
            ""function"": {
              ""class"": ""uk.gov.gchq.gaffer.function.ExampleFilterFunction""
            },
            ""selection"": [""dateProperty""]
          }
        ]
      }
    },
    ""globalElements"": [
      {
        ""groupBy"": [""property1""],
        ""transientProperties"": {
          ""property2"": ""java.lang.String""

Add an example of adding vertex cardinalities to the Getting Started guide,"This basically involves adding a 'Cardinality' Entity onto every vertex. The 'Cardinality' entity needs to have a HyperLogLogPlus property. Then in your element generator, whenever an edge (A to B) is created, it should also create cardinality entities at A and B.

These cardinality entities will then be aggregated automatically and will provide an estimate of the connectivity of each vertex in the graph.

To create the cardinality entities for an edge, you can do something like:
```java
final HyperLogLogPlus hllpSource = new HyperLogLogPlus(5, 5);
hllpSource.offer(edge.getDestination());
final Entity sourceCardinality = new Entity.Builder()
        .vertex(edge.getSource())

        .property(""edgeGroup"", edge.getGroup())
        .property(""hllp"", hllpSource)

final HyperLogLogPlus hllpDest = new HyperLogLogPlus(5, 5);
hllpSource.offer(edge.getSource());
final Entity destCardinality = new Entity.Builder()
        .vertex(edge.getDestination())

Changes:
1. Set the response header `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` and omit the `Content-Length` header. Server platforms often take care of this for you - Node and Jetty both support it out of the box. For more info see the MDN docs for Transfer-Encoding. 
2. Form the response in such a way that the browser can deal with it one line at a time. For example, CSV and newline-delimited JSON objects work well. A single JSON object or Array doesn't work because the browser needs to read the whole response into memory to parse it.

Provide visibility serialiser that's compatible with Accumulo's built-in visibility filtering,"We should provide a serialiser for string visibilities that works as you'd expect with Accumulo's built-in visibility filtering approach, e.g. if the visibility is ""vis1&vis2"" and the user has Accumulo authorisations ""vis1"" and ""vis2"", then they should be able to see it. This serialiser should automatically be used if the provided visibility property is a string. It should deal with the valid visibility of the empty string.

Note that it's possible that this already works fine with our standard string serialiser, but there don't seem to be any unit tests that check the combination of visibilities is dealt with correctly.

Visibility property not returned from queries in Accumulo Store,"If data with a visibility is inserted into an `AccumuloStore`, with the visibility property set, then it is not returned as part of the properties when a query is made.

                .elements(elements)
                .build();
graph.execute(addElements, new User());
```

Run a query:

```
GetRelatedElements<EntitySeed, Element> get = new GetRelatedElements.Builder<EntitySeed, Element>()
                .addSeed(new EntitySeed(""A""))
                .build();
CloseableIterable<Element> results = graph.execute(get, new User());
for (final Element e : results) {
          System.out.println(e);
}
results.close();
```

Then the result is:

```
Entity{vertex=A, group='entityGroup', properties={}}
```

The result should be:

```
Entity{vertex=A, group='entityGroup', properties={myVisibility=<java.lang.String>}} 
```

It's not clear whether this only happens when the visibility is the empty string, or whether it happens with any visibility - further testing is needed.

A unit test should be added to avoid this problem occurring again.

Indexing of properties in Accumulo store,"The `AccumuloStore` should offer the option to index properties. It seems difficult to index the properties that are constantly changing as they are being aggregated, but it should be possible to index the properties used in the `groupBy` values. If for example one of the group by properties was colour, then this would make it possible to ask questions such as ""find all the red edges"". This will require the creation of a separate table from the main graph table.

For some of the group by properties there may be a relatively large number of elements that match, so a sharded index may be best. Using a document-partitioned index will allow questions such as ""find all the edges that are red and have property X"".

Issues that will need consideration:

AbstractCoreKeyAccumuloElementConverter has unnecessary call to System.currentTimeMillis(),"There are two places in `AbstractCoreKeyAccumuloElementConverter` where there is a call to `System.currentTimeMillis()` which is ignored if a timestamp has been provided. As this is called for every `Element` that is inserted, that's a lot of potentially expensive overhead. The `buildTimestamp` method should call `System.currentTimeMillis()` only if it needs to because no timestamp has been provided.

Two other issues with this class could be fixed at the same time (separate issues can be raised if necessary): there is a reference to `new byte[0]` but elsewhere in the class `AccumuloStoreConstants.EMPTY_BYTES` is used instead; in `getKeyFromEntity` there is a comment that ""Row key is formed from identifier and group"" - this is not true - it should say ""Row key is formed from vertex"".

GetAllElements builder offers invalid method,"The `Builder` for `GetAllElements` offers an `addSeed` method but this is not valid for this operation. As the only reason for the existence of the builder is to make it easy to create a valid instance of the operation, it should not offer this method.

Also:
-  `GetAllElements` is a `GetElements<ElementSeed>` - shouldn't it be a `GetElements<Void>`?
- The `setIncludeIncomingOutGoing` method currently says that it is only possible to set this to outgoing edges only. This doesn't make sense - there is no concept of outgoing for `GetAllElements`. It would be better if this method threw an `IllegalArgumentException` (even if under the hood it uses that option to avoid returning the same edge twice).

Spark operation handlers for Accumulo store don't implement all options,"The following options on `GetRDDOfElements`, `GetRDDOfAllElements`, `GetJavaRDDOfElements` and `GetDataFrameOfElements` are either not implemented or cause exceptions or don't make sense: `deduplicate`, `limitResults`, `populateProperties`. For the latter operation, `addSeed` is offered but doesn't make sense.

Both the `deduplicate` and `limitResults` options on get operations assume that the result is a `CloseableIterable` - this is not true in the general case. Some operations will either not offer these options, or will implement them in their own way.

These issues have become more visible due to the recent changes to the builders which cause all methods to be exposed, but the issues were there before that.

Marking this as a bug because if the options are offered they should work.

- Review whether we should be lazily deserialising key-values to elements so that parts are only deserialised as necessary to run a filter or transform.

FreqMap for longs,"The `FreqMap` class currently maps strings to integers. It would be useful to be able to store longs in a frequency map.

Alternatively, a `LongFreqMap` class could be written. So the options are:
- Create a new `LongFreqMap` class.
- Change `FreqMap` so that it is a map from String to long.

As there is no serialisation overhead in using a long, I suggest option 2, but opinions are welcome.

This relates to #389.

Number of reducers for bulk import,"When bulk importing to Accumulo, the number of reducers is set based on the number of split points. This can cause problems in two situations:
- If there are a large number of split points, but a small amount of data is being ingested, then a large number of reducers are used and this can slow the job down. The method `connector.tableOperations.getSplits(<table name>,<max splits>)` provides optimal splits up to a maximum number.
- If there is a large amount of data to be imported, but the table is new and only has a small number of split points then there will be a small number of reducers and the job will take a long time to run.

Two options to the `AddElementsFromHdfs` operation should be added: the first allows a maximum number of reducers to be specified. The second causes more reducers than the number of splits to be used - there is a method on  `RangePartitioner` called `setNumSubBins` to help with this.

Specifying split file in Accumulo bulk import,"The split file for bulk imports to Accumulo is currently specified in two places: in the store properties (option `accumulo.splits.file.path`) and as an option on the `AddElementsFromHdfs` operation (`accumulostore.operation.hdfs.user_provided_splits_file`). The first case is used when the operation will create the splits file from the split points that are currently on the table; the latter is used when the user provides the split file (as should happen when the user samples the data to find sensible split points prior to the first import to the table).
- It is confusing that the splits file is specified in two different places depending on a subtle difference in use.
- The splits file does not belong in the store properties - it is a property of a particular bulk import operation, not the store. There might be multiple bulk import operations happening at the same time and in this case if the same store properties file was used then the files would clash. When this happens an IOException with the message ""Resource hdfs://server/splits_file changed on src filesystem (expected ____ was ____)"".

Suggest:
- The splits file should be removed from the store properties, and should always be specified by the option on the operation.
- There should be an option on the operation to say whether the splits are to be found from the table and written to the splits file, or to be taken from the user provided splits file.

Range scans and comparators,"When given a pair of `EntitySeeds`, the `GetElementsInRanges` operation returns all elements containing a vertex that is between the first and second `EntitySeed`. In the `AccumuloStore` this requires the vertex serialisation to preserve the ordering of the vertices. However the store does not know if this is the case. And the vertices might not even be comparable.

In more detail, the issues are:
- It is possible to apply the `GetElementsInRanges` operation to data with vertices which are not comparable. In this case the operation is meaningless and should not be allowed.
- If the vertices are comparable then the store does not know if the serialisation preserves the ordering. For example, if the vertex is an integer then a fixed length serialisation might preserve the ordering, but a variable length one would not. The store is therefore unable to decide if it can safely apply the operation.
- Some vertex types are naturally comparable in more than one way. For example, a type-value pair could be comparable in two different ways - considering type first then value, or value first then type. In the first case, typeA|value1 < typeB|avalue2; in the second the opposite is true, i.e. typeB|avalue2 < typeA|value1. Different serialisers can be chosen to preserve the first ordering or the second ordering. In this case the store needs to know which comparator the user wants to use for the range scan, and it needs to know whether the serialisation respects this.

This situation will lead to user error as they execute a range scan without understanding the subtleties.

Note that arguing that the ordering should purely be based on the serialised value of the vertices ignores stores that do not need to serialise data and which can do range scans based on the actual ordering of the objects.

A possible solution is:
- If the vertex is not Comparable then refuse to run the operation.
- If the vertex is Comparable then `GetElementsInRanges` assumes that this is in respect of the ordering specified by the compare method on the vertex (unless an option says otherwise - see next item). If this is running on a store that serialises the vertices, it asks the vertex serialiser whether it preserves the ordering. If it does it runs the operation; if not then it refuses to run the operation.
- If `GetElementsInRanges` is called with an option which says a specific Comparator is intended to be used then the vertex serialiser is asked whether it preserves the ordering specified by that Comparator. It it does, it runs the operation; if it doesn't it refuses.

Note that this is linked to #268 - the default serialiser for a vertex that is an int should probably be one that respects the natural ordering of ints; the default serialiser for an int that is just a property should be `CompactRawIntSerialiser`.

Create TypeValue vertex type,"It is common to identify a vertex using a pair of strings, type and value, e.g. customer A or film B. Serialisation of this pair of strings is not trivial, unless it is known for certain that a certain character, e.g. ""|"", will not appear in either the type or the value (in this case that character can be used as a delimiter). If this is not known, then the serialisation needs to delimit the two strings so that they can be unambiguously deserialised later. This needs to be done in a way that preserves the ordering so that range scans work. One way to do this is to convert each string to a byte array, remove the 0 byte from each of these using `ByteArrayEscapeUtils`, and then use the 0 byte as the delimiter. This should preserver the ordering.

Gaffer should provide a TypeValue type and a serialiser.

Additionally, a TypeSubtypeValue vertex could be provided.

Bulk import to Accumulo store,"To bulk import data to a new table in Accumulo, the following steps are necessary:
- Estimate split points from a sample of the data you want to ingest.
- Create table.
- Set the split points on the table.
- Convert the data to rfiles of Accumulo keys and values.
- Hand those files to Accumulo.

To help bulk import data to a new graph backed by an Accumulo store, the following operations are provided:
- `SampleDataForSplitPoints` - this creates a file of split points.
- `SplitTable` - this splits a table but does not create the table.
- `AddElementsFromHdfs` - this creates the table if it does not exist, but does not add split points. It hands the data over to Accumulo.

To use these operations to bulk import to a new graph, it is necessary to run `SampleDataForSplitPoints`, then run `SplitTable`, then run `AddElementsFromHdfs`. This is overly complex, and not documented properly.

It should be possible to run one operation, which bulk imports data to a new graph - this operation should run all the above steps. Chaining the `SampleDataForSplitPoints`, `SplitTable` and `AddElementsFromHdfs` operations together should work. It would be useful to create one operation which runs all of these.

Build fails with Accumulo 1.7.*,"Accumulo versions 1.6.\* and 1.7.\* should both be supported by Gaffer. Currently, the build (of the develop branch) fails if the version of Accumulo is set to 1.7.2 in the master pom. This is because one of the dependencies used by BatchScannerElementInputFormat depends on Accumulo 1.6 and uses classes that are not present in 1.7.

A short-term fix is to remove the InputFormat that causes the problem, and remove the dependencies it needs.

Accumulo 1.7 and later contains functionality to cause the same effect as BatchScannerElementInputFormat, so this input format should just be removed.

Locality groups in Accumulo store,"Accumulo's locality groups could be used so that queries that only require certain groups do not have to scan other groups (see http://accumulo.apache.org/1.7/accumulo_user_manual#_locality_groups). This is very natural with the current approach of storing the group in the column family, as a locality group is just a set of column families.

A sensible default option might be for different groups to be stored in different locality groups. This should speed up scans which require only a subset of the groups. Once locality groups are enabled, Accumulo will automatically take advantage of them when the `fetchColumnFamilies` method is called (which is already used in Gaffer).

Serialisation of properties in Value in Accumulo store,"In the Accumulo store, properties that go in the Value are serialised by adding the properties to a MapWritable and then converting that to bytes. This serialises the number of properties, then the first property name, and the first property value, then the second property and second value, etc. Storing the property names is wasteful of storage, and as they are specified in the schema is unnecessary. It would take less storage to write out the properties in a defined order (either the order they are specified in the schema, or in alphabetical order), with a list of their serialised sizes in bytes. The advantage of the current approach is that it potentially makes it easier to allow schemas to evolve on an existing table. So this should be optional for the Accumulo store.

Create CountGroups operation,"When querying a graph it is often useful to be able to see a summary of the number of groups an operation would return.

For example:

If you execute a GetRelatedElements operation with seed ""vertex1"" it could return:

``` json
Edge {""source"": ""vertex1"", ""destination"": ""vertex2"", ""directed"": true, ""group"": ""groupA""}
Edge {""source"": ""vertex1"", ""destination"": ""vertex3"", ""directed"": true, ""group"": ""groupA""}
Edge {""source"": ""vertex3"", ""destination"": ""vertex4"", ""directed"": true, ""group"": ""groupA""}
Edge {""source"": ""vertex4"", ""destination"": ""vertex5"", ""directed"": true, ""group"": ""groupB""}
Entity {""vertex"": ""vertex1"", ""group"": ""groupA""}
Entity {""vertex"": ""vertex1"", ""group"": ""groupB""}
```

If you execute an OperationChain of GetRelatedElements followed by CountGroups it could return:

``` json
entityGroups: {""groupA"": 1, ""groupB"": 1}
edgeGroups: {""groupA"": 3, ""groupB"": 1}
```

The CountGroups operation consist of:
input: Iterable<? Extends Element>
output: GroupCounts

Where GroupCounts looks a bit like:

``` java
// Map of entity group to count
Map<String, Integer> entityGroups;

// Map of edge group to count
Map<String, Integer> edgeGroups;
```

This operation should have a default handler in the Store class.

Same groups for Entities and Edges,"Currently, the same groups are not allowed to be used in Entities and Edges - if they are a message of ""Groups must not be shared between Entity definitions and Edge definitions"" is produced and then a `SchemaException` is thrown.

A very common use-case is to have a graph with say Edges with a group of ""red"", edges with a group of ""blue"", and then to have Entities with the same groups which contain the corresponding properties. E.g. the red edges have a count statistic, and each end of the edge has a red Entity associated with it which also contains a count (which is the count aggregated from all the red edges that that vertex is involved in). Similarly the blue edges might have a frequency map property, and there would also be blue vertices with that property that aggregate over associated edges.

It seems wrong to force the user to have a group of ""EntityRed"" for the Entities and ""EdgeRed"" for the Edges.

Is there a good reason for this restriction?

Warn when an Accumulo store is initialised against an existing non-Gaffer table,"If a user manually creates an Accumulo table (without adding Gaffer's iterators), and then creates a graph using store properties containing that table name, then the Accumulo initialise method will correctly notice that the table exists and not reinitialise it. This means that as far as Gaffer is concerned the table was created correctly, but actually it is just an empty table with no iterators.

This has caused confusion with some users as they manually create the table, then create the graph, then add data and notice that no aggregation is happening, which is then reported as a bug or a misconfiguration.

It's not clear what they best way to deal with this is. Options:
- If the table is already present the `ensureTableExists` method in `TableUtils` should log this, and say something like ""Table X already exists. For correct operation it must have been created using Gaffer code.""

Specification of aggregation logic,"Gaffer has the concept of aggregation. There are two types: persistent and query time. Technically though, Gaffer does not perform aggregation, it performs a reduce function: a group-by followed by an aggregation.

Currently, in the Accumulo store, aggregation is specified by specifying aggregators for some / all of the properties. The group-by function is not specified explicitly. It is specified implicitly by the choices the user makes about where properties go in Accumulo's key and value.

There are a few problems with this approach:
- It is too easy to get wrong.
- The concepts of an Accumulo key and a group-by key for the aggregation are confused.
- If a store that has no concept of a key is used, or if Accumulo is used in a different way, then there is no mechanism to specify the group-by function.
- The writer of the schema has to have knowledge of internal Accumulo concepts like column qualifier, visibility and value.

It would be better to specify, on a per-group basis, the desired group-by logic. For example, suppose an edge of group G has the following properties: time window, visibility, count. The user wants persistent aggregation to happen over time window and visibility, e.g. suppose the following edges are inserted:
- A->B of group G with timewindow=20160101-02, visibility=public, count=1
- A->B of group G with timewindow=20160101-02, visibility=private, count=1
- A->B of group G with timewindow=20160101-02, visibility=public, count=2

The the user wants the public visibility edges to be merged so that the database should contain:
- A->B of group G with timewindow=20160101-02, visibility=private, count=1
- A->B of group G with timewindow=20160101-02, visibility=public, count=3

To specify this behaviour, the following properties are needed:
- property=count:
  - type=int
  - aggregator=sum
  - aggregationkeys=timewindow,visibility

The Accumulo store should be able to decide where to store the three properties based on this specification (in practice it might be necessary for the same aggregation keys to be specified for all the properties within a group, but this can be checked at store creation time).

Now consider query-time aggregation and suppose the graph contains:
- A->B of group G with timewindow=20160101-02, visibility=private, count=1
- A->B of group G with timewindow=20160101-02, visibility=public, count=2
- A->B of group G with timewindow=20160102-03, visibility=private, count=5
- A->B of group G with timewindow=20160103-04, visibility=public, count=8
- A->C of group G with timewindow=20160107-08, visibility=private, count=100

There are multiple types of query-time aggregation that the user might want to be performed when A is queried for, e.g.
- (1) Aggregate timewindow, visibility and count to get:
  - A->B of group G with timewindow=201601-04, visibility=private&public, count=16
  - A->C of group G with timewindow=20160107-08, visibility=private, count=100
- (2) Aggregate visibility and count to get:
  - A->B of group G with timewindow=20160101-02, visibility=private&public, count=3
  - A->B of group G with timewindow=20160102-03, visibility=private, count=5
  - A->B of group G with timewindow=20160103-04, visibility=public, count=8
  - A->C of group G with timewindow=20160107-08, visibility=private, count=100
- (3) Aggregate destination, timewindow, visibility and count to get:
  - A->{B,C} of group G with timewindow=20160101-08, visibility=private&public, count=116

What is needed to specify these different behaviours?
- Case (1): Aggregate functions for timewindow, visibility and count. Aggregation keys of edge and group.
- Case (2): Aggregate functions for visibility and count. Aggregation keys of edge, group and timewindow.
- Case (3): Aggregate functions for vertex, timewindow, visibility and count. Aggregation key of group.

In practice, the types of aggregation that can be performed are limited by the capabilities of the store. In the case of Accumulo, one wants to limit the amount of data cached in the tablet server as the aggregation is performed. For example, it is unlikely to be sensible to aggregate over destination, timewindow, visibility but not count - that would require caching an edge for each distinct count, and nothing can be output until all of A's edges have been read. This could mean caching millions of edges and would put strain on the tablet server.

Currently the view is not flexible enough to allow these different types of group-by logic to be specified, and the store cannot specify which types it supports and which it doesn't. This has already led to confusion about the natural meaning of ""aggregation"" in range scans.

Again, the meaning of aggregation is not clearly defined enough.

Ordering of properties:

In an Accumulo store, the natural way to implement persistent aggregation is to put the grouping keys in the column qualifier and the values to be aggregated in the value. The ordering of the properties in the column qualifier effects the efficiency of some queries. For example, suppose that timewindow and visibility are in the column qualifier and the user queries for the edge A->B with a filter saying that only timewindow 20160102-03 is required. If the timewindow is the first property in the column qualifier then the range scan set up to find everything about edges A->B can skip all other timewindows. If the filter says that all timewindows are required but only one visibility is required then this has to be done by a filtering iterator. Currently the Accumulo store is not smart enough to spot this opportunity and optimise this query. This is really a different issue to the above aggregation issues but it is mentioned here because it has been said that allowing the user to specify in the schema where properties go in Accumulo's key-values allows these sort of optimisations later. This may be true, but again there is no need to specify rowkeys, column qualifier, etc - it is the ordering of the properties in the key that matters.

There is a similar issue with ordering of properties in the value - if the user specifies that in the properties in the graph elements that they receive back from a query they only want to see the count property and not the other properties that are being aggregated, then if the count property is first in the value that can be deserialised and the rest of the value skipped (if there are multiple properties including complex ones such as bitmaps then avoiding the deserialisation cost of these could be significant). Again, this means that the ordering of properties could be important. The store could advertise that ordering properties in certain ways allows it to perform certain optimisations. But again there should be no need to specify which part of the Accumulo key and value.

One is slow because it converts the int to a String and converts that to a byte array but has the advantage of only needing 1 byte to serialise some small values; the other is likely quicker but always uses 4 bytes. In many cases, when ints are stored they are mostly very small. The approach of Hadoop's VIntWritable should be (almost) as quick as the latter and as compact as the former. So suggest adding an implementation based on this. To avoid introducing a dependency on Hadoop in the serialisation library, suggest just copying the code from Hadoop, and acknowledging it in the NOTICES file.

Operation chain builder generics stops some valid operation chains,"It should be possible to chain a getAdjacentEntitySeeds operation with a getRelatedEdges, i.e.:

``` java
new OperationChain.Builder()

            .addSeed(new EntitySeed(""1""))
            .build())
    .then(new GetRelatedEdges())
    .build();
```

The operation chain requires the output from op 1 to be compatible with the input to op2. In this example the output from op1 is Iterable[EntitySeed] and the input from op2 is Iterable[ElementSeed]. As EntitySeed is an extension of ElementSeed this should be allowed.

We could open up the operation chain so it doesn't check the generic types - but this could lead to operation chains being invalid. Alternatively we could change the input type of GetRelatedEdges to [? extends ElementSeed]. This second option is preferable, but knock on implications need to be checked and we should should also update other operations such as GetRelatedEntities to [? extends ElementSeed] too.
### Current workaround

Cast the GetRelatedEdges into GetEdges and ignore the unchecked assignment warning.

``` java
new OperationChain.Builder()
    .first(new GetAdjacentEntitySeeds.Builder()
            .addSeed(new EntitySeed(""1""))
            .build())

Create a User object with userId and dataAuths,"Currently operation authorisations are provided using an operation option in Accumulo. It should be moved out of Accumulo as other stores will want authorisations too. It would be clearer if a User object was passed to Graph along with the operation/operation chain. This user object should contain the following:
- userId - to allow the graph to log information about the operations carried out
- dataAuths - user authorisations for the type of data they are allowed to see

Could we change zookeeper instance or caching it?,"Hi,

In the code below, we find constructing the ZooKeeper instance is very time-consuming, but when the getConnector function is called every time, the ZooKeeper instance will be reconstructed.

here the ZooKeeper instance is a local object, could we change it into a global one or Cache the Object? 

By the way, by Caching the hbase connection object, we can speed up the query process.

how to speed up queries,"Hi gaffer guys,

I want to know how to speed up queries, in our sense, there are 70000000+ verticls and 30000000+ edges, we have 8 accumulo servers,

it takes 4 seconds for 1-level depths, and 6 seconds for 2-level depths, 8 seconds for 3-level depths, is it NORMAL ?

how I speed up the query process and whether it connects the zookeeper every time when I query?

about different search depth,"Hi all,

In our scene, we focus on the query's QPS for the database, so we want to compare gaffer with neo4j, Titan to obtain the performance indicator in different search depth,

but I don't find the API for 2-level depth relations, 3-level depth relations and 4-level depth relations. Could you tell me how to do it ? 

By the way , could I blind the tinkerpop to gaffer ? Could gaffer support the query language,such as, gremlin or sparkql ? 

Thanks.

Create an operation cache,"This might involve 2 operations:
- UpdateCache - stores the input in the cache (with a provided string key) and returns the input
- FetchCache - returns the entire cache
- FetchCachedResults - returns results from the cache with the provided key

The cache should work for elements or just objects and allow users to cache steps of an operation chain separately - this could be achieved by passing in a key as part of the UpdateCache operation.

For small amounts of data a `HashMap<String, Iterable<Object>>` would work for for the cache. We could consider added options to UpdateCache to specify the type of cache you wish to use - for example the cache could be a new Gaffer graph.

For example:
- Build up a graph of all vertices traversed

``` java
final Iterable<?> cachedResults = graph.execute(new Builder()
    .first(new GetAdjacentEntitySeeds.Builder()
            .addSeed(new EntitySeed(""A""))
            .build())
    .then(new UpdateCache())
    .then(new GetAdjacentEntitySeeds())
    .then(new UpdateCache())
    .then(new FetchCachedResult())
    .build());
```
- Get related edges and entities separately

``` java
final Map<String, Iterable<?>> cachedResults = graph.execute(new Builder()
        .first(new GetAdjacentEntitySeeds.Builder()
                .addSeed(new EntitySeed(""A""))
                .build())
        .then(new UpdateCache(""adj-seeds""))
        .then(new GetEntitiesBySeed())
        .then(new UpdateCache(""entities""))
        .then(new FetchCachedResult(""adj-seeds""))
        .then(new GetRelatedEdges())
        .then(new UpdateCache(""edges""))
        .then(new FetchCache())
        .build());

Need help to resolve it !

Add Accumulostore SplitTable Operation.,"The accumulostore should have an operation to add split points to a table, 
These split points should be able to be generated by providing a directory of sample data, which will be used to create the splits.

In use this should be used as part of an operation chain when loading in data particularly for the first time,

Improve Function library interfaces,"Currently it is awkward to write Function implementations due to the inputs and outputs being an Object[]. It would also be nice if we could remove the requirement for the Inputs and Outputs annotation to define the object types.

Ideally a FilterFunction should not have to cast the parameters into the required types, something like:

``` java
public class FilterFunctionExample extends FilterFunction {
    @Override
    public boolean filter(final String param1, final Integer param2) {
        // do something
    }
}
```

The Function package names could also be improved to make it a bit clearer what interfaces you should use.

The method name in FilterFunction could be ""isValid"" instead of ""filter"" this would make it clearer what the method does.

We have investigated several different options, each having different advantages, but none are perfect. The best so far is something like:

``` java
public abstract class FilterFunction {
    public abstract boolean isValid(Object[] input);
}

public abstract class SimpleFilterFunction<T> extends FilterFunction {
        public boolean isValid(Object[] input) {
            return isValid((T) input[0]);
        }
        protected abstract boolean isValid(T item);
}

public class IsTrue extends SimpleFilterFunction <Boolean> {
    public boolean isValid(Boolean item) {
        return Boolean.TRUE.equals(item);
    }
}
```

Add extra logging to the Filter processor,"If an element fails validation it can be very difficult to find out why. It would be very useful to add additional logging to the Filter processor, so that when an element is filtered out based on a data schema it logs the function name and the property that was invalid. 

We have 2 options:
- When elements are invalid based on a data schema we could log at 'warn' level. When elements are filtered out based on a View it is probably best not to log anything to avoid slowing the operations down - this may require an extra flag to toggle logging on and off in the processor.
- Log at 'debug' level for all filtering (data schema and view). Then users will have to set the level to 'debug' temporarily to see the extra information.

Refactor AddElementsFromHdfsHandler in AccumuloStore,"The AddElementsFromHdfsHandler should be changed to do the following:

The default behaviour should be set to being; using the options passed to the job through the operation/ including the reducer number and partitioner.

If an option is provided to the operation specifying that the user would like to use standard gaffer behaviour and the user also provides a splits file, then this file will be used as the job's reducer number (Any user provided reducer numbers will be over-ridden by the number of splits +1)  and the AccumuloKeyRange partitioner will be used (Replacing any previously specified one).

If no splits file has been set and the user would like to use standard gaffer behaviour, then gaffer will query the accumulo table for its split points and use those for the number of reducers (+1) and will use the AccumuloKeyRange partitioner. 

General changes will include:
Making clear the purpose of the splits file property in the accumulo store over one provided in an operation with additional comments in the store properties.
Change the default number of reducers for a job up from 1 to 25 to better reflect use at scale.
Adding an option to provide a partitioner to the AddElementsFromHdfs operation builder.

Add store validation trait,"A new store trait (STORE_VALIDATION) will be used to allow store implementations to continuously validate elements and remove elements that are no longer valid. This will also allow custom age off and expiration filters to be written based on FilterFunctions. For example, you could age off elements based on properties, e.g (timestamp > x) AND (count < y).

Accumulo store should support store validation by adding a new validation iterator. 
NOTE - the previous AgeOff accumulo iterator will no longer be used. To migrate to using the new store validator, store schemas will need to be updated to add an AgeOff validator function for each element group that needs to be aged off.  

Added a new AccumuloProperty ""gaffer.store.accumulo.enable.validator.iterator"" to disable the store validation if it is not required.

The previous VALIDATION trait has been removed as validation is handled via a validation operation automatically so it wouldn't make sense for a store not to be able to validate the elements. There is still the option to disable validation.
